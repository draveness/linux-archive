	  This enables support for the Auvertech TurboPAM ISDN-card.
	  For running this card, additional firmware is necessary, which has
	  to be downloaded into the card using a utility which is distributed
	  separately from the Auvertech's web site: <http://www.auvertech.fr/>.

	  Please redirect all support questions to support@auvertech.fr.
