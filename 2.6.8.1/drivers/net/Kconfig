config NETDEVICES
	depends on NET
	bool "Network device support"
	---help---
	  You can say N here if you don't intend to connect your Linux box to
	  any other computer at all.

	  You'll have to say Y if your computer contains a network card that
	  you want to use under Linux. If you are going to run SLIP or PPP over
	  telephone line or null modem cable you need say Y here. Connecting
	  two machines with parallel ports using PLIP needs this, as well as
	  AX.25/KISS for sending Internet traffic over amateur radio links.

	  See also "The Linux Network Administrator's Guide" by Olaf Kirch and
	  Terry Dawson. Available at <http://www.tldp.org/guides.html>.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config DUMMY
	tristate "Dummy net driver support"
	depends on NETDEVICES
	---help---
	  This is essentially a bit-bucket device (i.e. traffic you send to
	  this device is consigned into oblivion) with a configurable IP
	  address. It is most commonly used in order to make your currently
	  inactive SLIP address seem like a real address for local programs.
	  If you use SLIP or PPP, you might want to say Y here. Since this
	  thing often comes in handy, the default is Y. It won't enlarge your
	  kernel either. What a deal. Read about it in the Network
	  Administrator's Guide, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#guide>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called dummy.  If you want to use more than one dummy
	  device at a time, you need to compile this driver as a module.
	  Instead of 'dummy', the devices will then be called 'dummy0',
	  'dummy1' etc.

config BONDING
	tristate "Bonding driver support"
	depends on NETDEVICES
	---help---
	  Say 'Y' or 'M' if you wish to be able to 'bond' multiple Ethernet
	  Channels together. This is called 'Etherchannel' by Cisco,
	  'Trunking' by Sun, and 'Bonding' in Linux.

	  If you have two Ethernet connections to some other computer, you can
	  make them behave like one double speed connection using this driver.
	  Naturally, this has to be supported at the other end as well, either
	  with a similar Bonding Linux driver, a Cisco 5500 switch or a
	  SunTrunking SunSoft driver.

	  This is similar to the EQL driver, but it merges Ethernet segments
	  instead of serial lines.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called bonding.

config EQUALIZER
	tristate "EQL (serial line load balancing) support"
	depends on NETDEVICES
	---help---
	  If you have two serial connections to some other computer (this
	  usually requires two modems and two telephone lines) and you use
	  SLIP (the protocol for sending Internet traffic over telephone
	  lines) or PPP (a better SLIP) on them, you can make them behave like
	  one double speed connection using this driver.  Naturally, this has
	  to be supported at the other end as well, either with a similar EQL
	  Linux driver or with a Livingston Portmaster 2e.

	  Say Y if you want this and read
	  <file:Documentation/networking/eql.txt>.  You may also want to read
	  section 6.2 of the NET-3-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called eql.  If unsure, say N.

config TUN
	tristate "Universal TUN/TAP device driver support"
	depends on NETDEVICES
	---help---
	  TUN/TAP provides packet reception and transmission for user space
	  programs.  It can be viewed as a simple Point-to-Point or Ethernet
	  device, which instead of receiving packets from a physical media,
	  receives them from user space program and instead of sending packets
	  via physical media writes them to the user space program.

	  When a program opens /dev/net/tun, driver creates and registers
	  corresponding net device tunX or tapX.  After a program closed above
	  devices, driver will automatically delete tunXX or tapXX device and
	  all routes corresponding to it.

	  Please read <file:Documentation/networking/tuntap.txt> for more
	  information.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called tun.

	  If you don't know what to use this for, you don't need it.

config ETHERTAP
	tristate "Ethertap network tap"
	depends on NETDEVICES && EXPERIMENTAL && NETLINK_DEV
	---help---
	  If you say Y here (and have said Y to "Kernel/User network link
	  driver", above) and create a character special file /dev/tap0 with
	  major number 36 and minor number 16 using mknod ("man mknod"), you
	  will be able to have a user space program read and write raw
	  Ethernet frames from/to that special file.  tap0 can be configured
	  with ifconfig and route like any other Ethernet device but it is not
	  connected to any physical LAN; everything written by the user to
	  /dev/tap0 is treated by the kernel as if it had come in from a LAN
	  to the device tap0; everything the kernel wants to send out over the
	  device tap0 can instead be read by the user from /dev/tap0: the user
	  mode program replaces the LAN that would be attached to an ordinary
	  Ethernet device. Please read the file
	  <file:Documentation/networking/ethertap.txt> for more information.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called ethertap.

	  If you don't know what to use this for, you don't need it.

config NET_SB1000
	tristate "General Instruments Surfboard 1000"
	depends on NETDEVICES && PNP
	---help---
	  This is a driver for the General Instrument (also known as
	  NextLevel) SURFboard 1000 internal
	  cable modem. This is an ISA card which is used by a number of cable
	  TV companies to provide cable modem access. It's a one-way
	  downstream-only cable modem, meaning that your upstream net link is
	  provided by your regular phone modem.

	  At present this driver only compiles as a module, so say M here if
	  you have this card. The module will be called sb1000. Then read
	  <file:Documentation/networking/README.sb1000> for information on how
	  to use this module, as it needs special ppp scripts for establishing
	  a connection. Further documentation and the necessary scripts can be
	  found at:

	  <http://www.jacksonville.net/~fventuri/>
	  <http://home.adelphia.net/~siglercm/sb1000.html>
	  <http://linuxpower.cx/~cable/>

	  If you don't have this card, of course say N.

config NET_ETHERNET
	bool "Ethernet (10 or 100Mbit)"
	---help---
	  Ethernet (also called IEEE 802.3 or ISO 8802-2) is the most common
	  type of Local Area Network (LAN) in universities and companies.

	  Common varieties of Ethernet are: 10BASE-2 or Thinnet (10 Mbps over
	  coaxial cable, linking computers in a chain), 10BASE-T or twisted
	  pair (10 Mbps over twisted pair cable, linking computers to central
	  hubs), 10BASE-F (10 Mbps over optical fiber links, using hubs),
	  100BASE-TX (100 Mbps over two twisted pair cables, using hubs),
	  100BASE-T4 (100 Mbps over 4 standard voice-grade twisted pair
	  cables, using hubs), 100BASE-FX (100 Mbps over optical fiber links)
	  [the 100BASE varieties are also known as Fast Ethernet], and Gigabit
	  Ethernet (1 Gbps over optical fiber or short copper links).

	  If your Linux machine will be connected to an Ethernet and you have
	  an Ethernet network interface card (NIC) installed in your computer,
	  say Y here and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. You will then also have
	  to say Y to the driver for your particular NIC.

	  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Ethernet network cards. If unsure, say N.

config MII
	tristate "Generic Media Independent Interface device support"
	depends on NET_ETHERNET
	help
	  Most ethernet controllers have MII transceiver either as an external
	  or internal device.  It is safe to say Y or M here even if your
	  ethernet card lack MII.

	help
	  Power Macintoshes and clones with Ethernet built-in on the
	  motherboard will usually use a MACE (Medium Access Control for
	  Ethernet) interface. Say Y to include support for the MACE chip.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called mace.

config MACE_AAUI_PORT
	bool "Use AAUI port instead of TP by default"
	depends on MACE
	help
	  Some Apple machines (notably the Apple Network Server) which use the
	  MACE ethernet chip have an Apple AUI port (small 15-pin connector),
	  instead of an 8-pin RJ45 connector for twisted-pair ethernet.  Say
	  Y here if you have such a machine.  If unsure, say N.
	  The driver will default to AAUI on ANS anyway, and if you use it as
	  a module, you can provide the port_aaui=0|1 to force the driver.

config BMAC

	  If you don't have one made for Apollos, you can use one from a PC,
	  except that your Apollo won't be able to boot from it (because the

	  PLIP (Parallel Line Internet Protocol) is used to create a

	  install a Linux distribution on a machine which doesn't have a
	  CD-ROM drive (a minimal system has to be transferred with floppies
	  first). The kernels on both machines need to have this PLIP option
	  enabled for this to work.

	  The PLIP driver has two modes, mode 0 and mode 1.  The parallel
	  ports (the connectors at the computers with 25 holes) are connected
	  with "null printer" or "Turbo Laplink" cables which can transmit 4
	  bits at a time (mode 0) or with special PLIP cables, to be used on
	  bidirectional parallel ports only, which can transmit 8 bits at a
	  time (mode 1); you can find the wiring of these cables in
	  <file:Documentation/networking/PLIP.txt>.  The cables can be up to
	  15m long.  Mode 0 works also if one of the machines runs DOS/Windows
	  and has some PLIP software installed, e.g. the Crynwr PLIP packet
	  driver (<http://oak.oakland.edu/simtel.net/msdos/pktdrvr-pre.html>)
	  and winsock or NCSA's telnet.

	  If you want to use PLIP, say Y and read the PLIP mini-HOWTO as well

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read

config PPP

	  PPP (Point to Point Protocol) is a newer and better SLIP.  It serves

	  serial) lines.  Ask your access provider if they support it, because
	  otherwise you can't use it; most Internet access providers these
	  days support PPP rather than SLIP.

	  To use PPP, you need an additional program called pppd as described
	  in the PPP-HOWTO, available at
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.  Make sure that you have
	  the version of pppd recommended in <file:Documentation/Changes>.
	  The PPP option enlarges your kernel by about 16 KB.

	  There are actually two versions of PPP: the traditional PPP for
	  asynchronous lines, such as regular analog phone lines, and
	  synchronous PPP which can be used over digital ISDN lines for
	  example.  If you want to use PPP over phone lines or other
	  asynchronous serial lines, you need to say Y (or M) here and also to
	  the next option, "PPP support for async serial ports".  For PPP over
	  synchronous lines, you should say Y (or M) here and to "Support
	  synchronous PPP", below.

	  If you said Y to "Version information on all symbols" above, then
	  you cannot compile the PPP driver into the kernel; you can then only
	  compile it as a module. To compile this driver as a module, choose M

	  The module will be called ppp_generic.

	bool "PPP multilink support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on PPP && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  PPP multilink is a protocol (defined in RFC 1990) which allows you
	  to combine several (logical or physical) lines into one logical PPP
	  connection, so that you can utilize your full bandwidth.

	  This has to be supported at the other end as well and you need a
	  version of the pppd daemon which understands the multilink protocol.

	  If unsure, say N.

config PPP_FILTER
	bool "PPP filtering"
	depends on PPP
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to be able to filter the packets passing over
	  PPP interfaces.  This allows you to control which packets count as
	  activity (i.e. which packets will reset the idle timer or bring up
	  a demand-dialled link) and which packets are to be dropped entirely.
	  You need to say Y here if you wish to use the pass-filter and
	  active-filter options to pppd.

	  If unsure, say N.

config PPP_ASYNC
	tristate "PPP support for async serial ports"
	depends on PPP
	select CRC_CCITT
	---help---
	  Say Y (or M) here if you want to be able to use PPP over standard
	  asynchronous serial ports, such as COM1 or COM2 on a PC.  If you use
	  a modem (not a synchronous or ISDN modem) to contact your ISP, you
	  need this option.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config PPP_SYNC_TTY
	tristate "PPP support for sync tty ports"
	depends on PPP
	help
	  Say Y (or M) here if you want to be able to use PPP over synchronous
	  (HDLC) tty devices, such as the SyncLink adapter. These devices
	  are often used for high-speed leased lines like T1/E1.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.

config PPP_DEFLATE
	tristate "PPP Deflate compression"
	depends on PPP
	select ZLIB_INFLATE
	select ZLIB_DEFLATE
	---help---
	  Support for the Deflate compression method for PPP, which uses the
	  Deflate algorithm (the same algorithm that gzip uses) to compress
	  each PPP packet before it is sent over the wire.  The machine at the
	  other end of the PPP link (usually your ISP) has to support the
	  Deflate compression method as well for this to be useful.  Even if
	  they don't support it, it is safe to say Y here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here.

config PPP_BSDCOMP
	tristate "PPP BSD-Compress compression"
	depends on PPP
	---help---
	  Support for the BSD-Compress compression method for PPP, which uses
	  the LZW compression method to compress each PPP packet before it is
	  sent over the wire. The machine at the other end of the PPP link
	  (usually your ISP) has to support the BSD-Compress compression
	  method as well for this to be useful. Even if they don't support it,
	  it is safe to say Y here.

	  The PPP Deflate compression method ("PPP Deflate compression",
	  above) is preferable to BSD-Compress, because it compresses better
	  and is patent-free.

	  Note that the BSD compression code will always be compiled as a
	  module; it is called bsd_comp and will show up in the directory
	  modules once you have said "make modules". If unsure, say N.

config PPPOE
	tristate "PPP over Ethernet (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && PPP
	help
	  Support for PPP over Ethernet.

	  This driver requires the latest version of pppd from the CVS
	  repository at cvs.samba.org.  Alternatively, see the 
	  RoaringPenguin package (http://www.roaringpenguin.com/pppoe)
	  which contains instruction on how to use this driver (under 
	  the heading "Kernel mode PPPoE").

config PPPOATM
	tristate "PPP over ATM"
	depends on ATM && PPP
	help
	  Support PPP (Point to Point Protocol) encapsulated in ATM frames.
	  This implementation does not yet comply with section 8 of RFC2364,
	  which can lead to bad results if the ATM peer loses state and
	  changes its encapsulation unilaterally.

config SLIP
	tristate "SLIP (serial line) support"
	depends on NETDEVICES
	---help---
	  Say Y if you intend to use SLIP or CSLIP (compressed SLIP) to
	  connect to your Internet service provider or to connect to some
	  other local Unix box or if you want to configure your Linux box as a
	  Slip/CSlip server for other people to dial in. SLIP (Serial Line
	  Internet Protocol) is a protocol used to send Internet traffic over
	  serial connections such as telephone lines or null modem cables;
	  nowadays, the protocol PPP is more commonly used for this same
	  purpose.

	  Normally, your access provider has to support SLIP in order for you
	  to be able to use it, but there is now a SLIP emulator called SLiRP
	  around (available from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/>) which
	  allows you to use SLIP over a regular dial up shell connection. If
	  you plan to use SLiRP, make sure to say Y to CSLIP, below. The
	  NET-3-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, explains how to
	  configure SLIP. Note that you don't need this option if you just
	  want to run term (term is a program which gives you almost full
	  Internet connectivity if you have a regular dial up shell account on
	  some Internet connected Unix computer. Read
	  <http://www.bart.nl/~patrickr/term-howto/Term-HOWTO.html>). SLIP
	  support will enlarge your kernel by about 4 KB. If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt>. The module will be
	  called slip.

config SLIP_COMPRESSED
	bool "CSLIP compressed headers"
	depends on SLIP
	---help---
	  This protocol is faster than SLIP because it uses compression on the
	  TCP/IP headers (not on the data itself), but it has to be supported
	  on both ends. Ask your access provider if you are not sure and
	  answer Y, just in case. You will still be able to use plain SLIP. If
	  you plan to use SLiRP, the SLIP emulator (available from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/>) which
	  allows you to use SLIP over a regular dial up shell connection, you
	  definitely want to say Y here. The NET-3-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, explains how to configure
	  CSLIP. This won't enlarge your kernel.

config SLIP_SMART
	bool "Keepalive and linefill"
	depends on SLIP
	help
	  Adds additional capabilities to the SLIP driver to support the
	  RELCOM line fill and keepalive monitoring. Ideal on poor quality
	  analogue lines.

config SLIP_MODE_SLIP6
	bool "Six bit SLIP encapsulation"
	depends on SLIP
	help
	  Just occasionally you may need to run IP over hostile serial
	  networks that don't pass all control characters or are only seven
	  bit. Saying Y here adds an extra mode you can use with SLIP:
	  "slip6". In this mode, SLIP will only send normal ASCII symbols over
	  the serial device. Naturally, this has to be supported at the other
	  end of the link as well. It's good enough, for example, to run IP
	  over the async ports of a Camtec JNT Pad. If unsure, say N.

config NET_FC
	bool "Fibre Channel driver support"
	depends on NETDEVICES && SCSI && PCI
	help
	  Fibre Channel is a high speed serial protocol mainly used to connect
	  large storage devices to the computer; it is compatible with and
	  intended to replace SCSI.

	  If you intend to use Fibre Channel, you need to have a Fibre channel
	  adaptor card in your computer; say Y here and to the driver for your
	  adaptor below. You also should have said Y to "SCSI support" and
	  "SCSI generic support".

config IPHASE5526
	tristate "Interphase 5526 Tachyon chipset based adapter support"
	depends on NET_FC && SCSI && PCI && BROKEN
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a Fibre Channel adaptor of this kind.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called iph5526.

config SHAPER
	tristate "Traffic Shaper (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on NETDEVICES && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  The traffic shaper is a virtual network device that allows you to
	  limit the rate of outgoing data flow over some other network device.
	  The traffic that you want to slow down can then be routed through
	  these virtual devices. See
	  <file:Documentation/networking/shaper.txt> for more information.

	  An alternative to this traffic shaper is the experimental
	  Class-Based Queueing (CBQ) scheduling support which you get if you
	  say Y to "QoS and/or fair queueing" above.

	  To set up and configure shaper devices, you need the shapecfg
	  program, available from <ftp://shadow.cabi.net/pub/Linux/> in the
	  shaper package.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called shaper.  If unsure, say N.

config NETCONSOLE
	tristate "Network console logging support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on NETDEVICES && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	If you want to log kernel messages over the network, enable this.
	See Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt for details.
