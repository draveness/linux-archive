	README
	------

	This directory is mostly for Wireless LAN drivers, in their
various incarnations (ISA, PCI, Pcmcia...).
	This separate directory is needed because a lot of driver work
on different bus (typically PCI + Pcmcia) and share 95% of the
code. This allow the code and the config options to be in one single
place instead of scattered all over the driver tree, which is never
100% satisfactory.

	Note : if you want more info on the topic of Wireless LANs,
you are kindly invited to have a look at the Wireless Howto :
		http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/
	Some Wireless LAN drivers, like orinoco_cs, require the use of
Wireless Tools to be configured :

	Special notes for distribution maintainers :
	1) wvlan_cs will be discontinued soon in favor of orinoco_cs
	2) Please add Wireless Tools support in your scripts

	Have fun...

	Jean
