config NET_RADIO
	bool "Wireless LAN drivers (non-hamradio) & Wireless Extensions"
	---help---
	  Support for wireless LANs and everything having to do with radio,
	  but not with amateur radio or FM broadcasting.

	  Saying Y here also enables the Wireless Extensions (creates
	  /proc/net/wireless and enables iwconfig access). The Wireless
	  Extension is a generic API allowing a driver to expose to the user
	  space configuration and statistics specific to common Wireless LANs.
	  The beauty of it is that a single set of tool can support all the
	  variations of Wireless LANs, regardless of their type (as long as
	  the driver supports Wireless Extension). Another advantage is that
	  these parameters may be changed on the fly without restarting the
	  driver (or Linux). If you wish to use Wireless Extensions with
	  wireless PCMCIA (PC-) cards, you need to say Y here; you can fetch
	  the tools from
	  <http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html>.

	  Some user-level drivers for scarab devices which don't require
	  special kernel support are available from
	  <ftp://shadow.cabi.net/pub/Linux/>.

# Note : the cards are obsolete (can't buy them anymore), but the drivers
# are not, as people are still using them...

config STRIP
	tristate "STRIP (Metricom starmode radio IP)"
	depends on NET_RADIO && INET
	---help---
	  Say Y if you have a Metricom radio and intend to use Starmode Radio
	  IP. STRIP is a radio protocol developed for the MosquitoNet project
	  (on the WWW at <http://mosquitonet.stanford.edu/>) to send Internet
	  traffic using Metricom radios.  Metricom radios are small, battery
	  powered, 100kbit/sec packet radio transceivers, about the size and
	  weight of a cellular telephone. (You may also have heard them called
	  "Metricom modems" but we avoid the term "modem" because it misleads
	  many people into thinking that you can plug a Metricom modem into a
	  phone line and use it as a modem.)

	  You can use STRIP on any Linux machine with a serial port, although
	  it is obviously most useful for people with laptop computers. If you
	  think you might get a Metricom radio in the future, there is no harm
	  in saying Y to STRIP now, except that it makes the kernel a bit
	  bigger.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called strip.

config ARLAN
	tristate "Aironet Arlan 655 & IC2200 DS support"
	depends on NET_RADIO && ISA && !64BIT
	---help---
	  Aironet makes Arlan, a class of wireless LAN adapters. These use the
	  www.Telxon.com chip, which is also used on several similar cards.
	  This driver is tested on the 655 and IC2200 series cards. Look at
	  <http://www.ylenurme.ee/~elmer/655/> for the latest information.

	  The driver is built as two modules, arlan and arlan-proc. The latter
	  is the /proc interface and is not needed most of time.

	  On some computers the card ends up in non-valid state after some
	  time. Use a ping-reset script to clear it.

config WAVELAN
	tristate "AT&T/Lucent old WaveLAN & DEC RoamAbout DS ISA support"
	depends on NET_RADIO && ISA
	---help---
	  The Lucent WaveLAN (formerly NCR and AT&T; or DEC RoamAbout DS) is
	  a Radio LAN (wireless Ethernet-like Local Area Network) using the
	  radio frequencies 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz.

	  This driver support the ISA version of the WaveLAN card.  A separate
	  driver for the PCMCIA (PC-card) hardware is available in David
	  Hinds' pcmcia-cs package (see the file <file:Documentation/Changes>
	  for location).

	  If you want to use an ISA WaveLAN card under Linux, say Y and read
	  the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. Some more specific
	  information is contained in
	  <file:Documentation/networking/wavelan.txt> and in the source code
	  <file:drivers/net/wavelan.p.h>.

	  You will also need the wireless tools package available from
	  <http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html>.
	  Please read the man pages contained therein.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be

	  (PC-card) wireless Ethernet networking card to your computer.  This
	  driver is for the non-IEEE-802.11 Wavelan cards.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be

config AIRO
	tristate "Cisco/Aironet 34X/35X/4500/4800 ISA and PCI cards"
	depends on NET_RADIO && ISA && (PCI || BROKEN)
	---help---
	  This is the standard Linux driver to support Cisco/Aironet ISA and
	  PCI 802.11 wireless cards.
	  It supports the new 802.11b cards from Cisco (Cisco 34X, Cisco 35X
	  - with or without encryption) as well as card before the Cisco
	  aquisition (Aironet 4500, Aironet 4800, Aironet 4800B).

	  This driver support both the standard Linux Wireless Extensions
	  and Cisco proprietary API, so both the Linux Wireless Tools and the
	  Cisco Linux utilities can be used to configure the card.

	  The driver can be compiled as a module and will be named "airo".

config HERMES
	tristate "Hermes chipset 802.11b support (Orinoco/Prism2/Symbol)"
	depends on NET_RADIO && (PPC_PMAC || PCI || PCMCIA)
	---help---
	  A driver for 802.11b wireless cards based based on the "Hermes" or
	  Intersil HFA384x (Prism 2) MAC controller.  This includes the vast
	  majority of the PCMCIA 802.11b cards (which are nearly all rebadges)
	  - except for the Cisco/Aironet cards.  Cards supported include the
	  Apple Airport (not a PCMCIA card), WavelanIEEE/Orinoco,
	  Cabletron/EnteraSys Roamabout, ELSA AirLancer, MELCO Buffalo, Avaya,
	  IBM High Rate Wireless, Farralon Syyline, Samsung MagicLAN, Netgear
	  MA401, LinkSys WPC-11, D-Link DWL-650, 3Com AirConnect, Intel
	  PRO/Wireless, and Symbol Spectrum24 High Rate amongst others.

	  This option includes the guts of the driver, but in order to
	  actually use a card you will also need to enable support for PCMCIA
	  Hermes cards, PLX9052 based PCI adaptors or the Apple Airport below.

	  You will also very likely also need the Wireless Tools in order to
	  configure your card and that /etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts works :

	help
	  Enable support for PCMCIA cards supported by the "Hermes" (aka
	  orinoco) driver when used in PLX9052 based PCI adaptors.  These
	  adaptors are not a full PCMCIA controller but act as a more limited
	  PCI <-> PCMCIA bridge.  Several vendors sell such adaptors so that
	  802.11b PCMCIA cards can be used in desktop machines.  The Netgear
	  MA301 is such an adaptor.

	  Support for these adaptors is so far still incomplete and buggy.
	  You have been warned.

config TMD_HERMES
	tristate "Hermes in TMD7160 based PCI adaptor support (EXPERIMENTAL)"

	  Enable support for PCI and mini-PCI 802.11b wireless NICs based on
	  the Prism 2.5 chipset.  These are true PCI cards, not the 802.11b
	  PCMCIA cards bundled with PCI<->PCMCIA adaptors which are also
	  common.  Some of the built-in wireless adaptors in laptops are of
	  this variety.

       ---help---
        A driver 802.11b wireless cards based on the Atmel fast-vnet
        chips. This driver supports standard Linux wireless extensions. 
 
        Many  cards based on this chipset do not have flash memory
        and need their firmware loaded at start-up. If yours is 
        one of these, you will need to provide a firmware image
        to be loaded into the card by the driver. The Atmel
        firmware package can be downloaded from
        http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/atmel

	  such as the Linksys, D-Link and Farallon Skyline.  It should also
	  work on Symbol cards such as the 3Com AirConnect and Ericsson WLAN.

	  To use your PC-cards, you will need supporting software from David
	  Hinds' pcmcia-cs package (see the file <file:Documentation/Changes>
