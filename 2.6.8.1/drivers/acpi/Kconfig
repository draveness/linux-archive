config ACPI
	bool "ACPI Support"
	depends on IA64 || X86

	default y
	---help---
	  Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) support for 
	  Linux requires an ACPI compliant platform (hardware/firmware),
	  and assumes the presence of OS-directed configuration and power
	  management (OSPM) software.  This option will enlarge your 
	  kernel by about 70K.

	  Linux ACPI provides a robust functional replacement for several 
	  legacy configuration and power management intefaces, including 
	  the Plug-and-Play BIOS specification (PnP BIOS), the 
	  MultiProcessor Specification (MPS), and the Advanced Power 
	  Management (APM) specification.  If both ACPI and APM support 
	  are configured, whichever is loaded first shall be used.

	  The ACPI SourceForge project contains the latest source code, 
	  documentation, tools, mailing list subscription, and other 
	  information.  This project is available at:
	  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/acpi>

	  Linux support for ACPI is based on Intel Corporation's ACPI
	  Component Architecture (ACPI CA).  For more information see:
	  <http://developer.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi>

	  ACPI is an open industry specification co-developed by Compaq, 
	  Intel, Microsoft, Phoenix, and Toshiba.  The specification is 
	  available at:
	  <http://www.acpi.info>

config ACPI_BOOT
	bool
	depends on ACPI || X86_HT
	default y

config ACPI_INTERPRETER
	bool
	depends on ACPI
	depends on !IA64_SGI_SN
	default y

config ACPI_SLEEP
	bool "Sleep States (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on X86 && ACPI
	depends on ACPI_INTERPRETER
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && PM
	default y
	---help---
	  This option adds support for ACPI suspend states. 

	  With this option, you will be able to put the system "to sleep". 
	  Sleep states are low power states for the system and devices. All
	  of the system operating state is saved to either memory or disk
	  (depending on the state), to allow the system to resume operation
	  quickly at your request.

	  Although this option sounds really nifty, barely any of the device
	  drivers have been converted to the new driver model and hence few
	  have proper power management support. 

	  This option is not recommended for anyone except those doing driver
	  power management development.

config ACPI_SLEEP_PROC_FS
	bool
	depends on ACPI_SLEEP && PROC_FS
	default y

config ACPI_AC
	tristate "AC Adapter"
	depends on X86
	depends on ACPI_INTERPRETER
	default m
	help
	  This driver adds support for the AC Adapter object, which indicates
	  whether a system is on AC, or not.  Typically, only mobile systems 
	  have this object, since desktops are always on AC.

config ACPI_BATTERY
	tristate "Battery"
	depends on X86
	depends on ACPI_INTERPRETER
	default m
	help
	  This driver adds support for battery information through
	  /proc/acpi/battery. If you have a mobile system with a battery, 
	  say Y.

config ACPI_BUTTON
	tristate "Button"
	depends on ACPI_INTERPRETER
	depends on !IA64_SGI_SN
	default m
	help
	  This driver registers for events based on buttons, such as the
	  power, sleep, and lid switch.  In the future, a daemon will read
	  /proc/acpi/event and perform user-defined actions such as shutting
	  down the system.  Until then, you can cat it, and see output when
	  a button is pressed.

config ACPI_FAN
	tristate "Fan"
	depends on ACPI_INTERPRETER
	depends on !IA64_SGI_SN
	default m
	help
	  This driver adds support for ACPI fan devices, allowing user-mode 
	  applications to perform basic fan control (on, off, status).

config ACPI_PROCESSOR
	tristate "Processor"
	depends on ACPI_INTERPRETER
	depends on !IA64_SGI_SN
	default m
	help
	  This driver installs ACPI as the idle handler for Linux, and uses
	  ACPI C2 and C3 processor states to save power, on systems that
	  support it.

config ACPI_THERMAL
	tristate "Thermal Zone"
	depends on ACPI_PROCESSOR
	default m
	help
	  This driver adds support for ACPI thermal zones.  Most mobile and
	  some desktop systems support ACPI thermal zones.  It is HIGHLY
	  recommended that this option be enabled, as your processor(s)
	  may be damaged without it.

config ACPI_NUMA
	bool "NUMA support"
	depends on ACPI_INTERPRETER
	depends on NUMA
	depends on IA64
	default y if IA64_GENERIC || IA64_SGI_SN2

config ACPI_ASUS
        tristate "ASUS/Medion Laptop Extras"
	depends on X86
	depends on ACPI_INTERPRETER
	default m
        ---help---
          This driver provides support for extra features of ACPI-compatible
          ASUS laptops. As some of Medion laptops are made by ASUS, it may also
          support some Medion laptops (such as 9675 for example).  It makes all
          the extra buttons generate standard ACPI events that go through
          /proc/acpi/events, and (on some models) adds support for changing the
          display brightness and output, switching the LCD backlight on and off,
          and most importantly, allows you to blink those fancy LEDs intended
          for reporting mail and wireless status.

	  Note: display switching code is currently considered EXPERIMENTAL,
	  toying with these values may even lock your machine.
          
          All settings are changed via /proc/acpi/asus directory entries. Owner
          and group for these entries can be set with asus_uid and asus_gid
          parameters.
          
          More information and a userspace daemon for handling the extra buttons
          at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/acpi4asus/>.
          
          If you have an ACPI-compatible ASUS laptop, say Y or M here. This
          driver is still under development, so if your laptop is unsupported or
          something works not quite as expected, please use the mailing list
          available on the above page (acpi4asus-user@lists.sourceforge.net)
          
config ACPI_TOSHIBA
	tristate "Toshiba Laptop Extras"
	depends on X86
	depends on ACPI_INTERPRETER
	default m
	---help---
	  This driver adds support for access to certain system settings
	  on "legacy free" Toshiba laptops.  These laptops can be recognized by
	  their lack of a BIOS setup menu and APM support.

	  On these machines, all system configuration is handled through the
	  ACPI.  This driver is required for access to controls not covered
	  by the general ACPI drivers, such as LCD brightness, video output,
	  etc.

	  This driver differs from the non-ACPI Toshiba laptop driver (located
	  under "Processor type and features") in several aspects.
	  Configuration is accessed by reading and writing text files in the
	  /proc tree instead of by program interface to /dev.  Furthermore, no
	  power management functions are exposed, as those are handled by the
	  general ACPI drivers.

	  More information about this driver is available at
	  <http://memebeam.org/toys/ToshibaAcpiDriver>.

	  If you have a legacy free Toshiba laptop (such as the Libretto L1
	  series), say Y.

config ACPI_DEBUG
	bool "Debug Statements"
	depends on ACPI_INTERPRETER
	depends on !IA64_SGI_SN
	default n
	help
	  The ACPI driver can optionally report errors with a great deal
	  of verbosity. Saying Y enables these statements. This will increase
	  your kernel size by around 50K.

config ACPI_BUS
	bool
	depends on ACPI_INTERPRETER
	depends on !IA64_SGI_SN
	default y

config ACPI_EC
	bool
	depends on X86
	depends on ACPI_INTERPRETER
	default y
	help
	  This driver is required on some systems for the proper operation of
	  the battery and thermal drivers.  If you are compiling for a 
	  mobile system, say Y.

config ACPI_POWER
	bool
	depends on ACPI_INTERPRETER
	depends on !IA64_SGI_SN
	default y

config ACPI_PCI
	bool
	depends on ACPI_INTERPRETER
	depends on !IA64_SGI_SN
	default PCI

config ACPI_SYSTEM
	bool
	depends on ACPI_INTERPRETER
	depends on !IA64_SGI_SN
	default y
	help
	  This driver will enable your system to shut down using ACPI, and
	  dump your ACPI DSDT table using /proc/acpi/dsdt.

config X86_PM_TIMER
	bool "Power Management Timer Support"
	depends on X86 && ACPI
	depends on ACPI_BOOT && EXPERIMENTAL
	depends on !X86_64
	default n
	help
	  The Power Management Timer is available on all ACPI-capable,
	  in most cases even if ACPI is unusable or blacklisted.

	  This timing source is not affected by powermanagement features
	  like aggressive processor idling, throttling, frequency and/or
	  voltage scaling, unlike the commonly used Time Stamp Counter
	  (TSC) timing source.

	  So, if you see messages like 'Losing too many ticks!' in the
	  kernel logs, and/or you are using this on a notebook which
	  does not yet have an HPET, you should say "Y" here.
