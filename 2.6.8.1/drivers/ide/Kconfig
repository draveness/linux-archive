config IDE
	tristate "ATA/ATAPI/MFM/RLL support"
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, your kernel will be able to manage low cost mass
	  storage units such as ATA/(E)IDE and ATAPI units. The most common
	  cases are IDE hard drives and ATAPI CD-ROM drives.

	  If your system is pure SCSI and doesn't use these interfaces, you
	  can say N here.

	  Integrated Disk Electronics (IDE aka ATA-1) is a connecting standard
	  for mass storage units such as hard disks. It was designed by
	  Western Digital and Compaq Computer in 1984. It was then named
	  ST506. Quite a number of disks use the IDE interface.

	  AT Attachment (ATA) is the superset of the IDE specifications.
	  ST506 was also called ATA-1.

	  Fast-IDE is ATA-2 (also named Fast ATA), Enhanced IDE (EIDE) is
	  ATA-3. It provides support for larger disks (up to 8.4GB by means of
	  the LBA standard), more disks (4 instead of 2) and for other mass
	  storage units such as tapes and cdrom. UDMA/33 (aka UltraDMA/33) is
	  ATA-4 and provides faster (and more CPU friendly) transfer modes
	  than previous PIO (Programmed processor Input/Output) from previous
	  ATA/IDE standards by means of fast DMA controllers.

	  ATA Packet Interface (ATAPI) is a protocol used by EIDE tape and
	  CD-ROM drives, similar in many respects to the SCSI protocol.

	  SMART IDE (Self Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) was
	  designed in order to prevent data corruption and disk crash by
	  detecting pre hardware failure conditions (heat, access time, and
	  the like...). Disks built since June 1995 may follow this standard.
	  The kernel itself doesn't manage this; however there are quite a
	  number of user programs such as smart that can query the status of
	  SMART parameters from disk drives.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ide.

	  For further information, please read <file:Documentation/ide.txt>.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	default 4
	help
	  This is the maximum number of IDE hardware interfaces that will
	  be supported by the driver. Make sure it is at least as high as
	  the number of IDE interfaces in your system.

config BLK_DEV_IDE
	tristate "Enhanced IDE/MFM/RLL disk/cdrom/tape/floppy support"
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, you will use the full-featured IDE driver to
	  control up to ten ATA/IDE interfaces, each being able to serve a
	  "master" and a "slave" device, for a total of up to twenty ATA/IDE
	  disk/cdrom/tape/floppy drives.

	  Useful information about large (>540 MB) IDE disks, multiple
	  interfaces, what to do if ATA/IDE devices are not automatically
	  detected, sound card ATA/IDE ports, module support, and other
	  topics, is contained in <file:Documentation/ide.txt>. For detailed
	  information about hard drives, consult the Disk-HOWTO and the
	  Multi-Disk-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To fine-tune ATA/IDE drive/interface parameters for improved
	  performance, look for the hdparm package at
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/hardware/>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/ide.txt>. The module will be called ide-mod.
	  Do not compile this driver as a module if your root file system (the
	  one containing the directory /) is located on an IDE device.

	  If you have one or more IDE drives, say Y or M here. If your system
	  has no IDE drives, or if memory requirements are really tight, you
	  could say N here, and select the "Old hard disk driver" below
	  instead to save about 13 KB of memory in the kernel.

config BLK_DEV_IDE_SATA
	bool "Support for SATA (deprecated; conflicts with libata SATA driver)"
	default n
	---help---
	  There are two drivers for Serial ATA controllers.

	  The main driver, "libata", exists inside the SCSI subsystem
	  and supports most modern SATA controllers.

	  The IDE driver (which you are currently configuring) supports
	  a few first-generation SATA controllers.

	  In order to eliminate conflicts between the two subsystems,
	  this config option enables the IDE driver's SATA support.
	  Normally this is disabled, as it is preferred that libata
	  supports SATA controllers, and this (IDE) driver supports
	  PATA controllers.

	  If unsure, say N.

config BLK_DEV_HD_IDE
	bool "Use old disk-only driver on primary interface"
	depends on (X86 || SH_MPC1211)
	---help---
	  There are two drivers for MFM/RLL/IDE disks.  Most people use just
	  the new enhanced driver by itself.  This option however installs the
	  old hard disk driver to control the primary IDE/disk interface in
	  the system, leaving the new enhanced IDE driver to take care of only
	  the 2nd/3rd/4th IDE interfaces.  Doing this will prevent you from
	  having an IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM or tape drive connected to the primary
	  IDE interface.  Choosing this option may be useful for older systems
	  which have MFM/RLL/ESDI controller+drives at the primary port
	  address (0x1f0), along with IDE drives at the secondary/3rd/4th port
	  addresses.

	  Normally, just say N here; you will then use the new driver for all
	  4 interfaces.

config BLK_DEV_IDEDISK
	tristate "Include IDE/ATA-2 DISK support"
	---help---
	  This will include enhanced support for MFM/RLL/IDE hard disks.  If
	  you have a MFM/RLL/IDE disk, and there is no special reason to use
	  the old hard disk driver instead, say Y.  If you have an SCSI-only
	  system, you can say N here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ide-disk.
	  Do not compile this driver as a module if your root file system
	  (the one containing the directory /) is located on the IDE disk.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config BLK_DEV_IDECD
	tristate "Include IDE/ATAPI CDROM support"
	---help---
	  If you have a CD-ROM drive using the ATAPI protocol, say Y. ATAPI is
	  a newer protocol used by IDE CD-ROM and TAPE drives, similar to the
	  SCSI protocol. Most new CD-ROM drives use ATAPI, including the
	  NEC-260, Mitsumi FX400, Sony 55E, and just about all non-SCSI
	  double(2X) or better speed drives.

	  If you say Y here, the CD-ROM drive will be identified at boot time
	  along with other IDE devices, as "hdb" or "hdc", or something
	  similar (check the boot messages with dmesg). If this is your only
	  CD-ROM drive, you can say N to all other CD-ROM options, but be sure
	  to say Y or M to "ISO 9660 CD-ROM file system support".

	  Note that older versions of LILO (LInux LOader) cannot properly deal
	  with IDE/ATAPI CD-ROMs, so install LILO 16 or higher, available from
	  <http://lilo.go.dyndns.org/>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ide-cd.

config BLK_DEV_IDETAPE
	tristate "Include IDE/ATAPI TAPE support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you have an IDE tape drive using the ATAPI protocol, say Y.
	  ATAPI is a newer protocol used by IDE tape and CD-ROM drives,
	  similar to the SCSI protocol.  If you have an SCSI tape drive
	  however, you can say N here.

	  You should also say Y if you have an OnStream DI-30 tape drive; this
	  will not work with the SCSI protocol, until there is support for the
	  SC-30 and SC-50 versions.

	  If you say Y here, the tape drive will be identified at boot time
	  along with other IDE devices, as "hdb" or "hdc", or something
	  similar, and will be mapped to a character device such as "ht0"
	  (check the boot messages with dmesg).  Be sure to consult the
	  <file:drivers/ide/ide-tape.c> and <file:Documentation/ide.txt> files
	  for usage information.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ide-tape.

config BLK_DEV_IDEFLOPPY
	tristate "Include IDE/ATAPI FLOPPY support"
	---help---
	  If you have an IDE floppy drive which uses the ATAPI protocol,
	  answer Y.  ATAPI is a newer protocol used by IDE CD-ROM/tape/floppy
	  drives, similar to the SCSI protocol.

	  The LS-120 and the IDE/ATAPI Iomega ZIP drive are also supported by
	  this driver. For information about jumper settings and the question
	  of when a ZIP drive uses a partition table, see
	  <http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/zip/zip-1.html>.
	  (ATAPI PD-CD/CDR drives are not supported by this driver; support
	  for PD-CD/CDR drives is available if you answer Y to
	  "SCSI emulation support", below).

	  If you say Y here, the FLOPPY drive will be identified along with
	  other IDE devices, as "hdb" or "hdc", or something similar (check
	  the boot messages with dmesg).

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ide-floppy.

config BLK_DEV_IDESCSI
	tristate "SCSI emulation support"
	depends on SCSI
	---help---
	  WARNING: ide-scsi is no longer needed for cd writing applications!
	  The 2.6 kernel supports direct writing to ide-cd, which eliminates
	  the need for ide-scsi + the entire scsi stack just for writing a
	  cd. The new method is more efficient in every way.

	  This will provide SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices,
	  and will allow you to use a SCSI device driver instead of a native
	  ATAPI driver.

	  This is useful if you have an ATAPI device for which no native
	  driver has been written (for example, an ATAPI PD-CD drive);
	  you can then use this emulation together with an appropriate SCSI
	  device driver. In order to do this, say Y here and to "SCSI support"
	  and "SCSI generic support", below. You must then provide the kernel
	  command line "hdx=ide-scsi" (try "man bootparam" or see the
	  documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to
	  pass options to the kernel at boot time) for devices if you want the
	  native EIDE sub-drivers to skip over the native support, so that
	  this SCSI emulation can be used instead.

	  Note that this option does NOT allow you to attach SCSI devices to a
	  box that doesn't have a SCSI host adapter installed.

	  If both this SCSI emulation and native ATAPI support are compiled
	  into the kernel, the native support will be used.

config IDE_TASK_IOCTL
	bool "IDE Taskfile Access"
	help
	  This is a direct raw access to the media.  It is a complex but
	  elegant solution to test and validate the domain of the hardware and
	  perform below the driver data recover if needed.  This is the most

config BLK_DEV_CMD640
	bool "CMD640 chipset bugfix/support"
	depends on X86
	---help---
	  The CMD-Technologies CMD640 IDE chip is used on many common 486 and
	  Pentium motherboards, usually in combination with a "Neptune" or
	  "SiS" chipset. Unfortunately, it has a number of rather nasty
	  design flaws that can cause severe data corruption under many common
	  conditions. Say Y here to include code which tries to automatically
	  detect and correct the problems under Linux. This option also
	  enables access to the secondary IDE ports in some CMD640 based
	  systems.

	  This driver will work automatically in PCI based systems (most new
	  systems have PCI slots). But if your system uses VESA local bus
	  (VLB) instead of PCI, you must also supply a kernel boot parameter
	  to enable the CMD640 bugfix/support: "ide0=cmd640_vlb". (Try "man
	  bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot loader about how to
	  pass options to the kernel.)

	  The CMD640 chip is also used on add-in cards by Acculogic, and on
	  the "CSA-6400E PCI to IDE controller" that some people have. For
	  details, read <file:Documentation/ide.txt>.

config BLK_DEV_CMD640_ENHANCED

config IDEPCI_SHARE_IRQ
	bool "Sharing PCI IDE interrupts support"
	depends on PCI && BLK_DEV_IDEPCI
	help
	  Some ATA/IDE chipsets have hardware support which allows for
	  sharing a single IRQ with other cards. To enable support for

	  It is safe to say Y to this question, in most cases.
	  If unsure, say N.

config BLK_DEV_OFFBOARD
	bool "Boot off-board chipsets first support"
	depends on PCI && BLK_DEV_IDEPCI
	help
	  Normally, IDE controllers built into the motherboard (on-board

	  cards (off-board controllers) are relegated to ide2 and ide3.
	  Answering Y here will allow you to reverse the situation, with
	  off-board controllers on ide0/1 and on-board controllers on ide2/3.
	  This can improve the usability of some boot managers such as lilo
	  when booting from a drive on an off-board controller.

	  If you say Y here, and you actually want to reverse the device scan
	  order as explained above, you also need to issue the kernel command
	  line option "ide=reverse". (Try "man bootparam" or see the
	  documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to
	  pass options to the kernel at boot time.)

	  This driver adds up to 4 more EIDE devices sharing a single
	  interrupt. This add-on card is a bootable PCI UDMA controller. Since
	  multiple cards can be installed and there are BIOS ROM problems that
	  happen if the BIOS revisions of all installed cards (three-max) do
	  not match, the driver attempts to do dynamic tuning of the chipset
	  at boot-time for max-speed.  Ultra33 BIOS 1.25 or newer is required
	  for more than one card. This card may require that you say Y to
	  "Special UDMA Feature".

	  If you say Y here, you need to say Y to "Use DMA by default when
	  available" as well.

	  It was originally designed for the PDC20246/Ultra33, whose BIOS will
	  only setup UDMA on the first two PDC20246 cards.  It has also been
	  used succesfully on a PDC20265/Ultra100, allowing use of UDMA modes
	  when the PDC20265 BIOS has been disabled (for faster boot up).
