config PNP
	bool "Plug and Play support"

	---help---
	  Plug and Play (PnP) is a standard for peripherals which allows those
	  peripherals to be configured by software, e.g. assign IRQ's or other
	  parameters. No jumpers on the cards are needed, instead the values
	  are provided to the cards from the BIOS, from the operating system,
	  or using a user-space utility.

	  Say Y here if you would like Linux to configure your Plug and Play
	  devices. You should then also say Y to all of the protocols below.
	  Alternatively, you can say N here and configure your PnP devices
	  using user space utilities such as the isapnptools package.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config PNP_DEBUG
	bool "PnP Debug Messages"
	depends on PNP
	help
	  Say Y if you want the Plug and Play Layer to print debug messages.
	  This is useful if you are developing a PnP driver or troubleshooting.
