config VGA_CONSOLE
	bool "VGA text console" if EMBEDDED || !X86
	depends on !ARCH_ACORN && !ARCH_EBSA110 && !4xx && !8xx && !SPARC32 && !SPARC64 && !M68K
	default y
	help
	  Saying Y here will allow you to use Linux in text mode through a
	  display that complies with the generic VGA standard. Virtually
	  everyone wants that.

	  The program SVGATextMode can be used to utilize SVGA video cards to
	  their full potential in text mode. Download it from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/console/>.

	  Say Y.

#	if [ "$CONFIG_PCI" = "y" -a "$CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE" = "y" ]; then
#	   bool '   Allow VGA on any bus?' CONFIG_VGA_HOSE
#	   if [ "$CONFIG_VGA_HOSE" = "y" ]; then
#	      define_bool CONFIG_DUMMY_CONSOLE y
#	   fi
#	fi

config VIDEO_SELECT
	bool "Video mode selection support"
	depends on  (X86 || X86_64) && VGA_CONSOLE
	---help---
	  This enables support for text mode selection on kernel startup. If
	  you want to take advantage of some high-resolution text mode your
	  card's BIOS offers, but the traditional Linux utilities like
	  SVGATextMode don't, you can say Y here and set the mode using the
	  "vga=" option from your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) or set
	  "vga=ask" which brings up a video mode menu on kernel startup. (Try
	  "man bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot loader about
	  how to pass options to the kernel.)

	  Read the file <file:Documentation/svga.txt> for more information
	  about the Video mode selection support. If unsure, say N.

config MDA_CONSOLE
	depends on !M68K
	tristate "MDA text console (dual-headed) (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you have an old MDA or monochrome Hercules graphics
	  adapter in your system acting as a second head ( = video card). You
	  will then be able to use two monitors with your Linux system. Do not
	  say Y here if your MDA card is the primary card in your system; the
	  normal VGA driver will handle it.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called mdacon.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SGI_NEWPORT_CONSOLE
        tristate "SGI Newport Console support"
        depends on SGI_IP22 
        help
          Say Y here if you want the console on the Newport aka XL graphics
          card of your Indy.  Most people say Y here.

#  bool 'IODC console' CONFIG_IODC_CONSOLE
config STI_CONSOLE
        tristate "STI text console" 
        depends on PARISC
        default y
        help
          The STI console is the builtin display/keyboard on HP-PARISC
          machines.  Say Y here to build support for it into your kernel.
          The alternative is to use your primary serial port as a console.

config DUMMY_CONSOLE_COLUMNS
        int "Initial number of console screen columns" if STI_CONSOLE
        depends on PARISC
        default "160"
        help
          The default value is 160, which should fit a 1280x1024 monitor.
          Select 80 if you use a 640x480 resolution by default.

config DUMMY_CONSOLE_ROWS
        int "Initial number of console screen rows" if STI_CONSOLE
        depends on PARISC
        default "64"
        help
          The default value is 64, which should fit a 1280x1024 monitor.
          Select 25 if you use a 640x480 resolution by default.

config PROM_CONSOLE
	bool "PROM console"
	depends on SPARC32 || SPARC64
	help
	  Say Y to build a console driver for Sun machines that uses the
	  terminal emulation built into their console PROMS.

config DUMMY_CONSOLE
	bool
	depends on PROM_CONSOLE!=y || VGA_CONSOLE!=y || SGI_NEWPORT_CONSOLE!=y 
	default y

config FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE
	tristate "Framebuffer Console support"
	depends on FB

config FONTS
	bool "Select compiled-in fonts"
	depends on FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE
	help
	  Say Y here if you would like to use fonts other than the default
	  your frame buffer console usually use.

	  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about foreign fonts.

	  If unsure, say N (the default choices are safe).

config FONT_8x8
	bool "VGA 8x8 font" if FONTS
	depends on FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE
	default y if !SPARC32 && !SPARC64 && !FONTS
	help
	  This is the "high resolution" font for the VGA frame buffer (the one
	  provided by the text console 80x50 (and higher) modes).

	  Note that this is a poor quality font. The VGA 8x16 font is quite a
	  lot more readable.

	  Given the resolution provided by the frame buffer device, answer N
	  here is safe.

config FONT_8x16
	bool "VGA 8x16 font" if FONTS
	depends on FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE || SGI_NEWPORT_CONSOLE=y
	default y if !SPARC32 && !SPARC64 && !FONTS
	help
	  This is the "high resolution" font for the VGA frame buffer (the one
	  provided by the VGA text console 80x25 mode.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config FONT_6x11
	bool "Mac console 6x11 font (not supported by all drivers)" if FONTS
	depends on FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE
	default y if !SPARC32 && !SPARC64 && !FONTS && MAC
	help
	  Small console font with Macintosh-style high-half glyphs.  Some Mac
	  framebuffer drivers don't support this one at all.

config FONT_PEARL_8x8
	bool "Pearl (old m68k) console 8x8 font" if FONTS
	depends on FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE
	default y if !SPARC32 && !SPARC64 && !FONTS && AMIGA
	help
	  Small console font with PC-style control-character and high-half
	  glyphs.

config FONT_ACORN_8x8
	bool "Acorn console 8x8 font" if FONTS
	depends on FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE
	default y if !SPARC32 && !SPARC64 && !FONTS && ARM && ARCH_ACORN
	help
	  Small console font with PC-style control characters and high-half
	  glyphs.

config FONT_MINI_4x6
	bool "Mini 4x6 font"
	depends on !SPARC32 && !SPARC64 && FONTS

config FONT_SUN8x16
	bool "Sparc console 8x16 font"
	depends on FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE && (!SPARC32 && !SPARC64 && FONTS || SPARC32 || SPARC64)
	help
	  This is the high resolution console font for Sun machines. Say Y.

config FONT_SUN12x22
	bool "Sparc console 12x22 font (not supported by all drivers)"
	depends on FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE && (!SPARC32 && !SPARC64 && FONTS || SPARC32 || SPARC64)
	help
	  This is the high resolution console font for Sun machines with very
	  big letters (like the letters used in the SPARC PROM). If the
	  standard font is unreadable for you, say Y, otherwise say N.
