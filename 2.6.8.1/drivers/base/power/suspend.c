 * All list on the suspend path are done in reverse order, so we operate
 * on the leaves of the device tree (or forests, depending on how you want
 * to look at it ;) first. As nodes are removed from the back of the list,

 * Things are the reverse on the resume path - iterations are done in

 * lists. This way, the ancestors will be accessed before their descendents.
