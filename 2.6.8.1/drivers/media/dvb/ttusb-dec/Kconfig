	  Support for external USB adapters designed by Technotrend and
	  produced by Hauppauge, shipped under the brand name 'DEC2000-t'
	  and 'DEC3000-s'.

          Even if these devices have a MPEG decoder built in, they transmit
	  only compressed MPEG data over the USB bus, so you need
	  an external software decoder to watch TV on your computer.	  

	  The DEC devices require firmware in order to boot into a mode in
	  which they are slaves to the PC.  See
	  <file:Documentation/dvb/ttusb-dec.txt> for details.

	  Say Y if you own such a device and want to use it.
