	depends on DVB_CORE && DVB_BT8XX
	help
	  Used in such cards as the VP-1020/1030, Twinhan DST,
	  VVmer TV@SAT. Say Y when you want to support frontends 
	  using this asic.

	  This module requires the dvb-bt8xx driver and dvb bt878
	  module.

config DVB_STV0299
	tristate "STV0299 based DVB-S frontend (QPSK)"
	depends on DVB_CORE
	help
	  The stv0299 by ST is used in many DVB-S tuner modules, 
	  say Y when you want to support frontends based on this 
	  DVB-S demodulator.

	  Some examples are the Alps BSRU6, the Philips SU1278 and
	  the LG TDQB-S00x.

	  If you don't know what tuner module is soldered on your 
	  DVB adapter simply enable all supported frontends, the 
	  right one will get autodetected.

config DVB_SP887X

 	depends on DVB_CORE
 	help
 	  A DVB-T demodulator driver. Say Y when you want to support the sp887x.
 
 	  If you don't know what tuner module is soldered on your
 	  DVB adapter simply enable all supported frontends, the
 	  right one will get autodetected.


config DVB_SP887X_FIRMWARE_FILE

        default "/usr/lib/hotplug/firmware/sc_main.mc"
        help
          This driver needs a copy of the Avermedia firmware. The version tested
	  is part of the Avermedia DVB-T 1.3.26.3 Application. This can be downloaded
	  from the Avermedia web site.
	  If the software is installed in Windows the file will be in the
	  /Program Files/AVerTV DVB-T/ directory and is called sc_main.mc.
	  Alternatively it can "extracted" from the install cab files but this will have
	  to be done in windows as I don't know of a linux version of extract.exe.
	  Copy this file to /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware/sc_main.mc.
	  With this version of the file the first 10 bytes are discarded and the next
	  0x4000 loaded. This may change in future versions.
