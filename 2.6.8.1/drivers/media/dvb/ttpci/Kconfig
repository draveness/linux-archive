	  Support for SAA7146 and AV7110 based DVB cards as produced

	  This driver only supports the fullfeatured cards with

	  The AV7110 firmware is normally loaded by the firmware hotplug manager.
	  If you want to compile the firmware into the driver you need to say
	  Y here and provide the correct path of the firmware. You need this
	  option if you want to compile the whole driver statically into the
	  kernel. 

	  All other people say N.

	help
	  The AV7110 firmware provides some code to generate an OnScreenDisplay
	  on the video output. This is kind of nonstandard and not guaranteed to
	  be maintained.

	  Anyway, some popular DVB software like VDR uses this OSD to render
	  its menus, so say Y if you want to use this software.

	  Note: The Common Interface is not yet supported by this driver
	  due to lack of information from the vendor.

	  Support for Budget Patch (full TS) modification on 
	  SAA7146+AV7110 based cards (DVB-S cards). This
	  driver doesn't use onboard MPEG2 decoder. The 
	  card is driven in Budget-only mode. Card is
	  required to have loaded firmware to tune properly.
	  Firmware can be loaded by insertion and removal of
	  standard AV7110 driver prior to loading this
	  driver.

	  Say Y if you own such a card and want to use it.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called budget-patch.
