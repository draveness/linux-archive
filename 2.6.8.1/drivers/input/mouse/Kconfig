	  Synaptics TouchPad users might be interested in a specialized
	  XFree86 driver at:
		http://w1.894.telia.com/~u89404340/touchpad/index.html
	  and a new verion of GPM at:
		http://www.geocities.com/dt_or/gpm/gpm.html
	  to take advantage of the advanced features of the touchpad.
	  If you do not want install specialized drivers but want tapping
	  working please use option psmouse.proto=imps.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  Say Y (or M) if you want to use a DEC VSXXX-AA (hockey

	  typically used on DECstations or VAXstations, but can also
	  be used on any box capable of RS232 (with some adaptor
	  described in the source file). This driver should, in theory,
	  also work with the digitizer DEC produced, but it isn't tested
	  with that (I don't have the hardware yet).
