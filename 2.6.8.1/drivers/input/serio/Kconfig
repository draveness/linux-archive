	default y
	---help---
	  Say Yes here if you have any input device that uses serial I/O to
	  communicate with the system. This includes the 
	  		* standard AT keyboard and PS/2 mouse *
	  as well as serial mice, Sun keyboards, some joysticks and 6dof
	  devices and more.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called serio.

	tristate "i8042 PC Keyboard controller" if EMBEDDED || !X86
	default y
	select SERIO
	depends on !PARISC
	---help---
	  i8042 is the chip over which the standard AT keyboard and PS/2
	  mouse are connected to the computer. If you use these devices,
	  you'll need to say Y here.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
