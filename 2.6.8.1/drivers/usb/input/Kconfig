config USB_HID
	tristate "USB Human Interface Device (full HID) support"
	depends on USB
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want full HID support to connect keyboards,
	  mice, joysticks, graphic tablets, or any other HID based devices
	  to your computer via USB. You also need to select HID Input layer
	  support (below) if you want to use keyboards, mice, joysticks and
	  the like.

	  You can't use this driver and the HIDBP (Boot Protocol) keyboard
	  and mouse drivers at the same time. More information is available:
	  <file:Documentation/input/input.txt>.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called usbhid.

	bool "HID input layer support"
	default y
	depends on INPUT && USB_HID
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use a USB keyboard, mouse or joystick,
	  or any other HID input device. You also need "Input core support", 
	  (CONFIG_INPUT), which you select under "Input device support", above.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config HID_FF
	bool "Force feedback support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB_HIDINPUT && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Say Y here is you want force feedback support for a few HID devices.
	  See below for a list of supported devices.

	  See <file:Documentation/input/ff.txt> for a description of the force
	  feedback API.

	  If unsure, say N.

config HID_PID
	bool "PID Devices (Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback 2)"
	depends on HID_FF
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a PID-compliant joystick and wish to enable force
	  feedback for it. The Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback 2 is one such
	  device.

config LOGITECH_FF
	bool "Logitech WingMan *3D support"
	depends on HID_FF
	help
	  Say Y here if you have one of these devices:
	  - Logitech WingMan Cordless RumblePad
	  - Logitech WingMan Force 3D
	  and if you want to enable force feedback for them.
	  Note: if you say N here, this device will still be supported, but without
	  force feedback.

config THRUSTMASTER_FF
	bool "ThrustMaster FireStorm Dual Power 2 support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on HID_FF && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a THRUSTMASTER FireStore Dual Power 2,
	  and want to enable force feedback support for it.
	  Note: if you say N here, this device will still be supported, but without
	  force feedback.

config USB_HIDDEV
	bool "/dev/hiddev raw HID device support"
	depends on USB_HID
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support HID devices (from the USB
	  specification standpoint) that aren't strictly user interface
	  devices, like monitor controls and Uninterruptable Power Supplies.

	  This module supports these devices separately using a separate
	  event interface on /dev/usb/hiddevX (char 180:96 to 180:111).
	  This driver requires CONFIG_USB_HID.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config USB_KBD
	tristate "USB HIDBP Keyboard (simple Boot) support"
	depends on USB && INPUT
	---help---
	  Say Y here only if you are absolutely sure that you don't want
	  to use the generic HID driver for your USB keyboard and prefer
	  to use the keyboard in its limited Boot Protocol mode instead.

	  This is almost certainly not what you want.  This is mostly
	  useful for embedded applications or simple keyboards.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called usbkbd.

	  If even remotely unsure, say N.

config USB_MOUSE
	tristate "USB HIDBP Mouse (simple Boot) support"
	depends on USB && INPUT
	---help---
	  Say Y here only if you are absolutely sure that you don't want
	  to use the generic HID driver for your USB mouse and prefer
	  to use the mouse in its limited Boot Protocol mode instead.

	  This is almost certainly not what you want.  This is mostly
	  useful for embedded applications or simple mice.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called usbmouse.

	  If even remotely unsure, say N.
