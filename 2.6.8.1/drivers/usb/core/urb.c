/**
 * usb_submit_urb - issue an asynchronous transfer request for an endpoint
 * @urb: pointer to the urb describing the request
 * @mem_flags: the type of memory to allocate, see kmalloc() for a list
 *	of valid options for this.
 *
 * This submits a transfer request, and transfers control of the URB
 * describing that request to the USB subsystem.  Request completion will
 * be indicated later, asynchronously, by calling the completion handler.
 * The three types of completion are success, error, and unlink
 * (a software-induced fault, also called "request cancelation").  
 *
 * URBs may be submitted in interrupt context.
 *
 * The caller must have correctly initialized the URB before submitting
 * it.  Functions such as usb_fill_bulk_urb() and usb_fill_control_urb() are
 * available to ensure that most fields are correctly initialized, for
 * the particular kind of transfer, although they will not initialize
 * any transfer flags.
 *
 * Successful submissions return 0; otherwise this routine returns a
 * negative error number.  If the submission is successful, the complete()
 * callback from the URB will be called exactly once, when the USB core and
 * Host Controller Driver (HCD) are finished with the URB.  When the completion
 * function is called, control of the URB is returned to the device
 * driver which issued the request.  The completion handler may then
 * immediately free or reuse that URB.
 *
 * With few exceptions, USB device drivers should never access URB fields
 * provided by usbcore or the HCD until its complete() is called.
 * The exceptions relate to periodic transfer scheduling.  For both
 * interrupt and isochronous urbs, as part of successful URB submission
 * urb->interval is modified to reflect the actual transfer period used
 * (normally some power of two units).  And for isochronous urbs,
 * urb->start_frame is modified to reflect when the URB's transfers were
 * scheduled to start.  Not all isochronous transfer scheduling policies
 * will work, but most host controller drivers should easily handle ISO
 * queues going from now until 10-200 msec into the future.
 *
 * For control endpoints, the synchronous usb_control_msg() call is
 * often used (in non-interrupt context) instead of this call.
 * That is often used through convenience wrappers, for the requests
 * that are standardized in the USB 2.0 specification.  For bulk
 * endpoints, a synchronous usb_bulk_msg() call is available.
 *
 * Request Queuing:
 *
 * URBs may be submitted to endpoints before previous ones complete, to
 * minimize the impact of interrupt latencies and system overhead on data
 * throughput.  With that queuing policy, an endpoint's queue would never
 * be empty.  This is required for continuous isochronous data streams,
 * and may also be required for some kinds of interrupt transfers. Such
 * queuing also maximizes bandwidth utilization by letting USB controllers
 * start work on later requests before driver software has finished the
 * completion processing for earlier (successful) requests.
 *
 * As of Linux 2.6, all USB endpoint transfer queues support depths greater
 * than one.  This was previously a HCD-specific behavior, except for ISO
 * transfers.  Non-isochronous endpoint queues are inactive during cleanup
 * after faults (transfer errors or cancelation).
 *
 * Reserved Bandwidth Transfers:
 *
 * Periodic transfers (interrupt or isochronous) are performed repeatedly,
 * using the interval specified in the urb.  Submitting the first urb to
 * the endpoint reserves the bandwidth necessary to make those transfers.
 * If the USB subsystem can't allocate sufficient bandwidth to perform
 * the periodic request, submitting such a periodic request should fail.
 *
 * Device drivers must explicitly request that repetition, by ensuring that
 * some URB is always on the endpoint's queue (except possibly for short
 * periods during completion callacks).  When there is no longer an urb
 * queued, the endpoint's bandwidth reservation is canceled.  This means
 * drivers can use their completion handlers to ensure they keep bandwidth
 * they need, by reinitializing and resubmitting the just-completed urb
 * until the driver longer needs that periodic bandwidth.
 *
 * Memory Flags:
 *
 * The general rules for how to decide which mem_flags to use
 * are the same as for kmalloc.  There are four
 * different possible values; GFP_KERNEL, GFP_NOFS, GFP_NOIO and
 * GFP_ATOMIC.
 *
 * GFP_NOFS is not ever used, as it has not been implemented yet.
 *
 * GFP_ATOMIC is used when
 *   (a) you are inside a completion handler, an interrupt, bottom half,
 *       tasklet or timer, or
 *   (b) you are holding a spinlock or rwlock (does not apply to
 *       semaphores), or
 *   (c) current->state != TASK_RUNNING, this is the case only after
 *       you've changed it.
 * 
 * GFP_NOIO is used in the block io path and error handling of storage
 * devices.
 *
 * All other situations use GFP_KERNEL.
 *
 * Some more specific rules for mem_flags can be inferred, such as
 *  (1) start_xmit, timeout, and receive methods of network drivers must
 *      use GFP_ATOMIC (they are called with a spinlock held);
 *  (2) queuecommand methods of scsi drivers must use GFP_ATOMIC (also
 *      called with a spinlock held);
 *  (3) If you use a kernel thread with a network driver you must use
 *      GFP_NOIO, unless (b) or (c) apply;
 *  (4) after you have done a down() you can use GFP_KERNEL, unless (b) or (c)
 *      apply or your are in a storage driver's block io path;
 *  (5) USB probe and disconnect can use GFP_KERNEL unless (b) or (c) apply; and
 *  (6) changing firmware on a running storage or net device uses
 *      GFP_NOIO, unless b) or c) apply
 *

/**
 * usb_unlink_urb - abort/cancel a transfer request for an endpoint
 * @urb: pointer to urb describing a previously submitted request,
 *	may be NULL
 *
 * This routine cancels an in-progress request.  URBs complete only
 * once per submission, and may be canceled only once per submission.
 * Successful cancelation means the requests's completion handler will
 * be called with a status code indicating that the request has been
 * canceled (rather than any other code) and will quickly be removed
 * from host controller data structures.
 *
 * In the past, clearing the URB_ASYNC_UNLINK transfer flag for the
 * URB indicated that the request was synchronous.  This usage is now
 * deprecated; if the flag is clear the call will be forwarded to
 * usb_kill_urb() and the return value will be 0.  In the future, drivers
 * should call usb_kill_urb() directly for synchronous unlinking.
 *
 * When the URB_ASYNC_UNLINK transfer flag for the URB is set, this
 * request is asynchronous.  Success is indicated by returning -EINPROGRESS,
 * at which time the URB will normally have been unlinked but not yet
 * given back to the device driver.  When it is called, the completion
 * function will see urb->status == -ECONNRESET.  Failure is indicated
 * by any other return value.  Unlinking will fail when the URB is not
 * currently "linked" (i.e., it was never submitted, or it was unlinked
 * before, or the hardware is already finished with it), even if the
 * completion handler has not yet run.
 *
 * Unlinking and Endpoint Queues:
 *
 * Host Controller Drivers (HCDs) place all the URBs for a particular
 * endpoint in a queue.  Normally the queue advances as the controller
 * hardware processes each request.  But when an URB terminates with any
 * fault (such as an error, or being unlinked) its queue stops, at least
 * until that URB's completion routine returns.  It is guaranteed that
 * the queue will not restart until all its unlinked URBs have been fully
 * retired, with their completion routines run, even if that's not until
 * some time after the original completion handler returns.
 *
 * This means that USB device drivers can safely build deep queues for
 * large or complex transfers, and clean them up reliably after any sort
 * of aborted transfer by unlinking all pending URBs at the first fault.
 *
 * Note that an URB terminating early because a short packet was received
 * will count as an error if and only if the URB_SHORT_NOT_OK flag is set.
 * Also, that all unlinks performed in any URB completion handler must
 * be asynchronous.
 *
 * Queues for isochronous endpoints are treated differently, because they
 * advance at fixed rates.  Such queues do not stop when an URB is unlinked.
 * An unlinked URB may leave a gap in the stream of packets.  It is undefined
 * whether such gaps can be filled in.
 *
 * When a control URB terminates with an error, it is likely that the
 * status stage of the transfer will not take place, even if it is merely
 * a soft error resulting from a short-packet with URB_SHORT_NOT_OK set.
