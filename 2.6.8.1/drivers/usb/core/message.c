 * usb_sg_wait - synchronously execute scatter/gather request

 *
 * This function blocks until the specified I/O operation completes.  It
 * leverages the grouping of the related I/O requests to get good transfer
 * rates, by queueing the requests.  At higher speeds, such queuing can
 * significantly improve USB throughput.
 *
 * There are three kinds of completion for this function.
 * (1) success, where io->status is zero.  The number of io->bytes
 *     transferred is as requested.
 * (2) error, where io->status is a negative errno value.  The number
 *     of io->bytes transferred before the error is usually less
 *     than requested, and can be nonzero.
 * (3) cancelation, a type of error with status -ECONNRESET that
 *     is initiated by usb_sg_cancel().
 *
 * When this function returns, all memory allocated through usb_sg_init() or
 * this call will have been freed.  The request block parameter may still be
 * passed to usb_sg_cancel(), or it may be freed.  It could also be
 * reinitialized and then reused.
 *
 * Data Transfer Rates:
 *
 * Bulk transfers are valid for full or high speed endpoints.
 * The best full speed data rate is 19 packets of 64 bytes each
 * per frame, or 1216 bytes per millisecond.
 * The best high speed data rate is 13 packets of 512 bytes each
 * per microframe, or 52 KBytes per millisecond.
 *
 * The reason to use interrupt transfers through this API would most likely
 * be to reserve high speed bandwidth, where up to 24 KBytes per millisecond
 * could be transferred.  That capability is less useful for low or full
 * speed interrupt endpoints, which allow at most one packet per millisecond,
 * of at most 8 or 64 bytes (respectively).
