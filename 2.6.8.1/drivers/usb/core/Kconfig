config USB_DEBUG
	bool "USB verbose debug messages"
	depends on USB
	help
	  Say Y here if you want the USB core & hub drivers to produce a bunch
	  of debug messages to the system log. Select this if you are having a
	  problem with USB support and want to see more of what is going on.

config USB_DEVICEFS
	bool "USB device filesystem"
	depends on USB
	---help---
	  If you say Y here (and to "/proc file system support" in the "File
	  systems" section, above), you will get a file /proc/bus/usb/devices
	  which lists the devices currently connected to your USB bus or
	  busses, and for every connected device a file named
	  "/proc/bus/usb/xxx/yyy", where xxx is the bus number and yyy the
	  device number; the latter files can be used by user space programs
	  to talk directly to the device. These files are "virtual", meaning
	  they are generated on the fly and not stored on the hard drive.

	  You may need to mount the usbfs file system to see the files, use
	  mount -t usbfs none /proc/bus/usb

	  For the format of the various /proc/bus/usb/ files, please read
	  <file:Documentation/usb/proc_usb_info.txt>.

	  Please note that this code is completely unrelated to devfs, the
	  "/dev file system support".

	  Most users want to say Y here.

config USB_BANDWIDTH
	bool "Enforce USB bandwidth allocation (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say Y here, the USB subsystem enforces USB bandwidth
	  allocation and will prevent some device opens from succeeding
	  if they would cause USB bandwidth usage to go above 90% of
	  the bus bandwidth.

	  If you say N here, these conditions will cause warning messages
	  about USB bandwidth usage to be logged and some devices or
	  drivers may not work correctly.

config USB_DYNAMIC_MINORS
	bool "Dynamic USB minor allocation (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  If you say Y here, the USB subsystem will use dynamic minor
	  allocation for any device that uses the USB major number.
	  This means that you can have more than 16 of a single type
	  of device (like USB printers).

	  If you are unsure about this, say N here.
