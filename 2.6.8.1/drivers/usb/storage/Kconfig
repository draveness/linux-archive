config USB_STORAGE
	tristate "USB Mass Storage support"
	depends on USB
	select SCSI
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to connect USB mass storage devices to your
	  computer's USB port. This is the driver you need for USB floppy drives,
	  USB hard disks, USB tape drives and USB CD-ROMs, along with
	  similar devices. This driver may also be used for some cameras and
	  card readers.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called usb-storage.

config USB_STORAGE_DEBUG
	bool "USB Mass Storage verbose debug"
	depends on USB_STORAGE
	help
	  Say Y here in order to have the USB Mass Storage code generate
	  verbose debugging messages.

config USB_STORAGE_RW_DETECT
	bool "USB Mass Storage Write-Protected Media Detection (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB_STORAGE && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Say Y here in order to have the USB Mass Storage code indicate to
	  the SCSI layer that using MODE SENSE(6) and MODE SENSE(10) to
	  determine if the media is write-protected is a good thing to do.

	  Many devices have historically had trouble with these commands,
	  hence the default 2.6.x behavior has been to suppress their use.
	  2.4.x used these commands with (at best) mixed results, often
	  crashing the firmware of the device.  However, the SCSI layer now
	  issues these commands in a manner more consistent with other
	  "popular" OSes, in an attempt to improve compatibility.

	  Saying Y here allows these commands to be sent to a USB device.
	  If you find a device this doesn't work for, switch to N and let
	  us know at usb-storage@lists.one-eyed-alien.net

	  If you say N here, the kernel will assume that all disk-like USB
	  devices are write-enabled.

config USB_STORAGE_DATAFAB
	bool "Datafab Compact Flash Reader support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB_STORAGE && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Support for certain Datafab CompactFlash readers.
	  Datafab has a web page at <http://www.datafabusa.com/>.

config USB_STORAGE_FREECOM
	bool "Freecom USB/ATAPI Bridge support"
	depends on USB_STORAGE
	help
	  Support for the Freecom USB to IDE/ATAPI adaptor.
	  Freecom has a web page at <http://www.freecom.de/>.

config USB_STORAGE_ISD200
	bool "ISD-200 USB/ATA Bridge support"
	depends on USB_STORAGE && BLK_DEV_IDE
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to use USB Mass Store devices based
	  on the In-Systems Design ISD-200 USB/ATA bridge.

	  Some of the products that use this chip are:

	  - Archos Jukebox 6000
	  - ISD SmartCable for Storage
	  - Taiwan Skymaster CD530U/DEL-0241 IDE bridge

	bool "Microtech/ZiO! CompactFlash/SmartMedia support"
	depends on USB_STORAGE
	help
	  Say Y here to support the Microtech/ZiO! CompactFlash reader.
	  There is a web page at <http://www.ziocorp.com/products/>.

config USB_STORAGE_HP8200e
	bool "HP CD-Writer 82xx support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB_STORAGE && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Say Y here to include additional code to support Hewlett-Packard
	  8200e/8210e/8230e CD-Writer Plus drives.

config USB_STORAGE_SDDR09
	bool "SanDisk SDDR-09 (and other SmartMedia) support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB_STORAGE && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Say Y here to include additional code to support the Sandisk SDDR-09
	  SmartMedia reader in the USB Mass Storage driver.
	  Also works for the Microtech Zio! SmartMedia reader.

config USB_STORAGE_SDDR55
	bool "SanDisk SDDR-55 SmartMedia support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB_STORAGE && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Say Y here to include additional code to support the Sandisk SDDR-55
	  SmartMedia reader in the USB Mass Storage driver.

config USB_STORAGE_JUMPSHOT
	bool "Lexar Jumpshot Compact Flash Reader (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB_STORAGE && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Say Y here to include additional code to support the Lexar Jumpshot
	  USB CompactFlash reader.
