config USB_EMI62
	tristate "EMI 6|2m USB Audio interface support"
	depends on USB
	---help---
	  This driver loads firmware to Emagic EMI 6|2m low latency USB
	  Audio and Midi interface.

	  After firmware load the device is handled with standard linux
	  USB Audio driver.

	  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called audio. If you want to compile it as a
	  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt>.

config USB_EMI26
	tristate "EMI 2|6 USB Audio interface support"
	depends on USB
	---help---
	  This driver loads firmware to Emagic EMI 2|6 low latency USB
	  Audio interface.

	  After firmware load the device is handled with standard linux
	  USB Audio driver.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called emi26.

config USB_TIGL
	tristate "Texas Instruments Graph Link USB (aka SilverLink) cable support"
	depends on USB
	---help---
	  If you own a Texas Instruments graphing calculator and use a 
	  TI-GRAPH LINK USB cable (aka SilverLink), then you might be 
	  interested in this driver.

	  If you enable this driver, you will be able to communicate with
	  your calculator through a set of device nodes under /dev.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called tiglusb.

	  If you don't know what the SilverLink cable is or what a Texas
	  Instruments graphing calculator is, then you probably don't need this
	  driver.

	  If unsure, say N.
