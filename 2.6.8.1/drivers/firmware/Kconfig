menu "Firmware Drivers"

config EDD
	tristate "BIOS Enhanced Disk Drive calls determine boot disk (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	depends on !IA64
	help
	  Say Y or M here if you want to enable BIOS Enhanced Disk Drive
	  Services real mode BIOS calls to determine which disk
	  BIOS tries boot from.  This information is then exported via sysfs.

	  This option is experimental, but believed to be safe,
	  and most disk controller BIOS vendors do not yet implement this feature.

config EFI_VARS
	tristate "EFI Variable Support via sysfs"
	depends on EFI
	default n
	help
	  If you say Y here, you are able to get EFI (Extensible Firmware
	  Interface) variable information via sysfs.  You may read,
	  write, create, and destroy EFI variables through this interface.

	  Note that using this driver in concert with efibootmgr requires
	  at least test release version 0.5.0-test3 or later, which is
	  available from Matt Domsch's website located at:
	  http://linux.dell.com/efibootmgr/testing/efibootmgr-0.5.0-test3.tar.gz

	  Subsequent efibootmgr releases may be found at:
	  http://linux.dell.com/efibootmgr

config EFI_PCDP
	bool "Console device selection via EFI PCDP or HCDP table"
	depends on ACPI && EFI && IA64
	default y if IA64
	help
	  If your firmware supplies the PCDP table, and you want to
	  automatically use the primary console device it describes
	  as the Linux console, say Y here.

	  If your firmware supplies the HCDP table, and you want to
	  use the first serial port it describes as the Linux console,
	  say Y here.  If your EFI ConOut path contains only a UART
	  device, it will become the console automatically.  Otherwise,
	  you must specify the "console=ttyS0" kernel boot argument.

	  You must also enable the appropriate drivers (serial, VGA, etc.)
