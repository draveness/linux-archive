config VT
	bool "Virtual terminal" if EMBEDDED
	select INPUT
	default y if !VIOCONS
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, you will get support for terminal devices with
	  display and keyboard devices. These are called "virtual" because you
	  can run several virtual terminals (also called virtual consoles) on
	  one physical terminal. This is rather useful, for example one
	  virtual terminal can collect system messages and warnings, another
	  one can be used for a text-mode user session, and a third could run
	  an X session, all in parallel. Switching between virtual terminals
	  is done with certain key combinations, usually Alt-<function key>.

	  The setterm command ("man setterm") can be used to change the
	  properties (such as colors or beeping) of a virtual terminal. The
	  man page console_codes(4) ("man console_codes") contains the special
	  character sequences that can be used to change those properties
	  directly. The fonts used on virtual terminals can be changed with
	  the setfont ("man setfont") command and the key bindings are defined
	  with the loadkeys ("man loadkeys") command.

	  You need at least one virtual terminal device in order to make use
	  of your keyboard and monitor. Therefore, only people configuring an
	  embedded system would want to say N here in order to save some
	  memory; the only way to log into such a system is then via a serial
	  or network connection.

	  If unsure, say Y, or else you won't be able to do much with your new
	  shiny Linux system :-)

config VT_CONSOLE
	bool "Support for console on virtual terminal" if EMBEDDED
	depends on VT
	default y
	---help---
	  The system console is the device which receives all kernel messages
	  and warnings and which allows logins in single user mode. If you
	  answer Y here, a virtual terminal (the device used to interact with
	  a physical terminal) can be used as system console. This is the most
	  common mode of operations, so you should say Y here unless you want
	  the kernel messages be output only to a serial port (in which case
	  you should say Y to "Console on serial port", below).

	  If you do say Y here, by default the currently visible virtual
	  terminal (/dev/tty0) will be used as system console. You can change
	  that with a kernel command line option such as "console=tty3" which
	  would use the third virtual terminal as system console. (Try "man
	  bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or
	  loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)

	  If unsure, say Y.

config HW_CONSOLE
	bool
	depends on VT && !S390 && !UM
	default y

config SERIAL_NONSTANDARD
	bool "Non-standard serial port support"
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you have any non-standard serial boards -- boards
	  which aren't supported using the standard "dumb" serial driver.
	  This includes intelligent serial boards such as Cyclades,
	  Digiboards, etc. These are usually used for systems that need many
	  serial ports because they serve many terminals or dial-in
	  connections.

	  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about non-standard serial boards.

	  Most people can say N here.

config COMPUTONE
	tristate "Computone IntelliPort Plus serial support"
	depends on SERIAL_NONSTANDARD && BROKEN_ON_SMP
	---help---
	  This driver supports the entire family of Intelliport II/Plus
	  controllers with the exception of the MicroChannel controllers and
	  products previous to the Intelliport II. These are multiport cards,
	  which give you many serial ports. You would need something like this
	  to connect more than two modems to your Linux box, for instance in
	  order to become a dial-in server. If you have a card like that, say
	  Y here and read <file:Documentation/computone.txt>.

	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && CYCLADES
	help
	  The Cyclades-Z family of multiport cards allows 2 (two) driver op
	  modes: polling and interrupt. In polling mode, the driver will check
	  the status of the Cyclades-Z ports every certain amount of time
	  (which is called polling cycle and is configurable). In interrupt
	  mode, it will use an interrupt line (IRQ) in order to check the
	  status of the Cyclades-Z ports. The default op mode is polling. If
	  unsure, say N.

	depends on SERIAL_NONSTANDARD && BROKEN_ON_SMP
	---help---
	  This is a driver for Digi International's Xx, Xeve, and Xem series
	  of cards which provide multiple serial ports. You would need
	  something like this to connect more than two modems to your Linux
	  box, for instance in order to become a dial-in server. This driver
	  supports the original PC (ISA) boards as well as PCI, and EISA. If
	  you have a card like this, say Y here and read the file

config UNIX98_PTYS
	bool "Unix98 PTY support" if EMBEDDED
	default y
	---help---
	  A pseudo terminal (PTY) is a software device consisting of two
	  halves: a master and a slave. The slave device behaves identical to
	  a physical terminal; the master device is used by a process to
	  read data from and write data to the slave, thereby emulating a
	  terminal. Typical programs for the master side are telnet servers
	  and xterms.

	  Linux has traditionally used the BSD-like names /dev/ptyxx for
	  masters and /dev/ttyxx for slaves of pseudo terminals. This scheme
	  has a number of problems. The GNU C library glibc 2.1 and later,
	  however, supports the Unix98 naming standard: in order to acquire a
	  pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo
	  terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo
	  terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/<number>. What was
	  traditionally /dev/ttyp2 will then be /dev/pts/2, for example.

	  All modern Linux systems use the Unix98 ptys.  Say Y unless

	  Linux has traditionally used the BSD-like names /dev/ptyxx

config PRINTER
	tristate "Parallel printer support"

	---help---
	  If you intend to attach a printer to the parallel port of your Linux
	  box (as opposed to using a serial printer; if the connector at the
	  printer has 9 or 25 holes ["female"], then it's serial), say Y.
	  Also read the Printing-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  It is possible to share one parallel port among several devices
	  (e.g. printer and ZIP drive) and it is safe to compile the
	  corresponding drivers into the kernel.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/parport.txt>.  The module will be called lp.

	  If you have several parallel ports, you can specify which ports to
	  use with the "lp" kernel command line option.  (Try "man bootparam"
	  or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about
	  how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)  The syntax of the
	  "lp" command line option can be found in <file:drivers/char/lp.c>.

	  If you have more than 8 printers, you need to increase the LP_NO
	  macro in lp.c and the PARPORT_MAX macro in parport.h.

config LP_CONSOLE
	bool "Support for console on line printer"
	depends on PRINTER
	---help---
	  If you want kernel messages to be printed out as they occur, you
	  can have a console on the printer. This option adds support for
	  doing that; to actually get it to happen you need to pass the
	  option "console=lp0" to the kernel at boot time.

	  If the printer is out of paper (or off, or unplugged, or too
	  busy..) the kernel will stall until the printer is ready again.
	  By defining CONSOLE_LP_STRICT to 0 (at your own risk) you
	  can make the kernel continue when this happens,
	  but it'll lose the kernel messages.

	  If unsure, say N.

config PPDEV
	tristate "Support for user-space parallel port device drivers"
	depends on PARPORT

	  Saying Y to this adds support for /dev/parport device nodes.  This
	  is needed for programs that want portable access to the parallel
	  port, for instance deviceid (which displays Plug-and-Play device
	  IDs).

	  This is the parallel port equivalent of SCSI generic support (sg).
	  It is safe to say N to this -- it is not needed for normal printing

	  If you own a Texas Instruments graphing calculator and use a
	  parallel link cable, then you might be interested in this driver.

	  If you enable this driver, you will be able to communicate with
	  your calculator through a set of device nodes under /dev. The
	  main advantage of this driver is that you don't have to be root
	  to use this precise link cable (depending on the permissions on
	  the device nodes, though).

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called tipar.

	help
	  Say Y here to include support for the thermal management hardware
	  found in the NetWinder. This driver allows the user to control the
	  temperature set points and to read the current temperature.

	  It is also possible to say M here to build it as a module (ds1620)
	  It is recommended to be used on a NetWinder, but it is not a
	  necessity.

config NWBUTTON
	tristate "NetWinder Button"
	depends on ARCH_NETWINDER
	---help---
	  If you say Y here and create a character device node /dev/nwbutton
	  with major and minor numbers 10 and 158 ("man mknod"), then every
	  time the orange button is pressed a number of times, the number of
	  times the button was pressed will be written to that device.

	  This is most useful for applications, as yet unwritten, which
	  perform actions based on how many times the button is pressed in a
	  row.

	  Do not hold the button down for too long, as the driver does not
	  alter the behaviour of the hardware reset circuitry attached to the
	  button; it will still execute a hard reset if the button is held
	  down for longer than approximately five seconds.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called nwbutton.

	  Most people will answer Y to this question and "Reboot Using Button"
	  below to be able to initiate a system shutdown from the button.

config NWBUTTON_REBOOT
	bool "Reboot Using Button"
	depends on NWBUTTON
	help
	  If you say Y here, then you will be able to initiate a system
	  shutdown and reboot by pressing the orange button a number of times.
	  The number of presses to initiate the shutdown is two by default,
	  but this can be altered by modifying the value of NUM_PRESSES_REBOOT
	  in nwbutton.h and recompiling the driver or, if you compile the
	  driver as a module, you can specify the number of presses at load
	  time with "insmod button reboot_count=<something>".

config NWFLASH

	---help---
	  If you say Y here and create a character device /dev/flash with
	  major 10 and minor 160 you can manipulate the flash ROM containing
	  the NetWinder firmware. Be careful as accidentally overwriting the
	  flash contents can render your computer unbootable. On no account
	  allow random users access to this device. :-)

config NVRAM

	---help---
	  If you say Y here and create a character special file /dev/nvram
	  with major number 10 and minor number 144 using mknod ("man mknod"),
	  you get read and write access to the extra bytes of non-volatile
	  memory in the real time clock (RTC), which is contained in every PC
	  and most Ataris.  The actual number of bytes varies, depending on the
	  nvram in the system, but is usually 114 (128-14 for the RTC).

	  This memory is conventionally called "CMOS RAM" on PCs and "NVRAM"
	  on Ataris. /dev/nvram may be used to view settings there, or to
	  change them (with some utility). It could also be used to frequently
	  save a few bits of very important data that may not be lost over
	  power-off and for which writing to disk is too insecure. Note
	  however that most NVRAM space in a PC belongs to the BIOS and you
	  should NEVER idly tamper with it. See Ralf Brown's interrupt list
	  for a guide to the use of CMOS bytes by your BIOS.

	  On Atari machines, /dev/nvram is always configured and does not need
	  to be selected.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called nvram.

	  will get access to the real time clock (or hardware clock) built
	  into your computer.

	  Every PC has such a clock built in. It can be used to generate
	  signals from as low as 1Hz up to 8192Hz, and can also be used
	  as a 24 hour alarm. It reports status information via the file
	  /proc/driver/rtc and its behaviour is set by various ioctls on
	  /dev/rtc.

	  If you run Linux on a multiprocessor machine and said Y to
	  "Symmetric Multi Processing" above, you should say Y here to read
	  and set the RTC in an SMP compatible fashion.

	  If you think you have a use for such a device (such as periodic data
