config WATCHDOG
	bool "Watchdog Timer Support"
	---help---
	  If you say Y here (and to one of the following options) and create a
	  character special file /dev/watchdog with major number 10 and minor
	  number 130 using mknod ("man mknod"), you will get a watchdog, i.e.:
	  subsequently opening the file and then failing to write to it for
	  longer than 1 minute will result in rebooting the machine. This
	  could be useful for a networked machine that needs to come back
	  online as fast as possible after a lock-up. There's both a watchdog
	  implementation entirely in software (which can sometimes fail to
	  reboot the machine) and a driver for hardware watchdog boards, which
	  are more robust and can also keep track of the temperature inside
	  your computer. For details, read <file:Documentation/watchdog/watchdog.txt>
	  in the kernel source.

	  The watchdog is usually used together with the watchdog daemon
	  which is available from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/daemons/watchdog/>. This daemon can
	  also monitor NFS connections and can reboot the machine when the process
	  table is full.

	  If unsure, say N.

config WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT
	bool "Disable watchdog shutdown on close"
	depends on WATCHDOG
	help
	  The default watchdog behaviour (which you get if you say N here) is
	  to stop the timer if the process managing it closes the file
	  /dev/watchdog. It's always remotely possible that this process might
	  get killed. If you say Y here, the watchdog cannot be stopped once
	  it has been started.

config SOFT_WATCHDOG
	tristate "Software watchdog"
	depends on WATCHDOG
	help
	  A software monitoring watchdog. This will fail to reboot your system
	  from some situations that the hardware watchdog will recover
	  from. Equally it's a lot cheaper to install.

	  The Intel Footbridge chip contains a builtin watchdog circuit. Say Y
	  here if you wish to use this. Alternatively say M to compile the
	  driver as a module, which will be called wdt285.

	  This driver does not work on all machines. In particular, early CATS

config I8XX_TCO
	tristate "Intel i8xx TCO Timer/Watchdog"
	depends on WATCHDOG && (X86 || IA64) && PCI
	---help---
	  Hardware driver for the TCO timer built into the Intel 82801
	  I/O Controller Hub family.  The TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)
	  timer is a watchdog timer that will reboot the machine after
	  its second expiration. The expiration time can be configured
	  with the "heartbeat" parameter.

	  On some motherboards the driver may fail to reset the chipset's
	  NO_REBOOT flag which prevents the watchdog from rebooting the
	  machine. If this is the case you will get a kernel message like
	  "failed to reset NO_REBOOT flag, reboot disabled by hardware".

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

	depends on WATCHDOG && X86
	help
	  This driver can be used with the watchdog timer found on some
	  single board computers, namely the 6010 PII based computer.
	  It may well work with other cards.  It reads port 0x443 to enable
	  and re-set the watchdog timer, and reads port 0x45 to disable
	  the watchdog.  If you have a card that behave in similar ways,
	  you can probably make this driver work with your card as well.

	  You can compile this driver directly into the kernel, or use
	  it as a module.  The module will be called sbc60xxwdt.

config INDYDOG

	depends on WATCHDOG && SGI_IP22
	help
	  Hardwaredriver for the Indy's/I2's watchdog. This is a
	  watchdog timer that will reboot the machine after a 60 second
	  timer expired and no process has written to /dev/watchdog during
	  that time.

# SUPERH Architecture

config SH_WDT
	tristate "SuperH Watchdog"
	depends on WATCHDOG && SUPERH
	help
	  This driver adds watchdog support for the integrated watchdog in the
	  SuperH processors. If you have one of these processors and wish
	  to have watchdog support enabled, say Y, otherwise say N.

	  As a side note, saying Y here will automatically boost HZ to 1000
	  so that the timer has a chance to clear the overflow counter. On
	  slower systems (such as the SH-2 and SH-3) this will likely yield
	  some performance issues. As such, the WDT should be avoided here
	  unless it is absolutely necessary.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called shwdt.

# SPARC64 Architecture

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called cpwatchdog.

	  If you do not have a CompactPCI model CP1400 or CP1500, or
	  another UltraSPARC-IIi-cEngine boardset with hardware watchdog,
	  you should say N to this option.

config WATCHDOG_RIO
	tristate "RIO Hardware Watchdog support"
	depends on WATCHDOG && SPARC64 && PCI
	help
	  Say Y here to support the hardware watchdog capability on Sun RIO
