config AGP

	---help---
	  AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port) is a bus system mainly used to
	  connect graphics cards to the rest of the system.

	  If you have an AGP system and you say Y here, it will be possible to
	  use the AGP features of your 3D rendering video card. This code acts
	  as a sort of "AGP driver" for the motherboard's chipset.

	  If you need more texture memory than you can get with the AGP GART
	  (theoretically up to 256 MB, but in practice usually 64 or 128 MB
	  due to kernel allocation issues), you could use PCI accesses
	  and have up to a couple gigs of texture space.

	  Note that this is the only means to have XFree4/GLX use
	  write-combining with MTRR support on the AGP bus. Without it, OpenGL
	  direct rendering will be a lot slower but still faster than PIO.

	  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
	  use GLX or DRI.  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called agpgart.

config AGP_ALI
	tristate "ALI chipset support"
	depends on AGP && X86 && !X86_64
	---help---
	  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of
	  XFree86 4.x on the following ALi chipsets.  The supported chipsets
	  include M1541, M1621, M1631, M1632, M1641,M1647,and M1651.
	  For the ALi-chipset question, ALi suggests you refer to
	  <http://www.ali.com.tw/eng/support/index.shtml>.

	  The M1541 chipset can do AGP 1x and 2x, but note that there is an
	  acknowledged incompatibility with Matrox G200 cards. Due to
	  timing issues, this chipset cannot do AGP 2x with the G200.
	  This is a hardware limitation. AGP 1x seems to be fine, though.

	  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
	  use GLX or DRI.  If unsure, say N.
