	  This driver is a replacement for (and was inspired by) an older
	  driver named i2c-philips-par.  The new driver supports more devices,
	  and makes it easier to add support for new devices.

	  on the parport driver.  This is meant for embedded systems. Don't say
	  Y here if you intend to say Y or M there.

config I2C_PARPORT_LIGHT
	tristate "Parallel port adapter (light)"
	depends on I2C
	select I2C_ALGOBIT
	help
	  This supports parallel port I2C adapters such as the ones made by
	  Philips or Velleman, Analog Devices evaluation boards, and more.
	  Basically any adapter using the parallel port as an I2C bus with
	  no extra chipset is supported by this driver, or could be.

	  This driver is a light version of i2c-parport.  It doesn't depend
	  on the parport driver, and uses direct I/O access instead.  This
	  might be prefered on embedded systems where wasting memory for
	  the clean but heavy parport handling is not an option.  The
	  drawback is a reduced portability and the impossibility to
	  dasiy-chain other parallel port devices.
	  
	  Don't say Y here if you said Y or M to i2c-parport.  Saying M to
	  both is possible but both modules should not be loaded at the same
	  time.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module 
	  will be called i2c-parport-light.
