config I2C_ALGOBIT
	tristate "I2C bit-banging interfaces"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  This allows you to use a range of I2C adapters called bit-banging
	  adapters.  Say Y if you own an I2C adapter belonging to this class
	  and then say Y to the specific driver for you adapter below.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module 
	  will be called i2c-algo-bit.

config I2C_ALGOPCF
	tristate "I2C PCF 8584 interfaces"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  This allows you to use a range of I2C adapters called PCF adapters.
	  Say Y if you own an I2C adapter belonging to this class and then say
	  Y to the specific driver for you adapter below.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module 
	  will be called i2c-algo-pcf.

config I2C_ALGOITE
	tristate "ITE I2C Algorithm"
	depends on MIPS_ITE8172 && I2C
	help
	  This supports the use of the ITE8172 I2C interface found on some MIPS
	  systems. Say Y if you have one of these. You should also say Y for
	  the ITE I2C peripheral driver support below.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module 
	  will be called i2c-algo-ite.
