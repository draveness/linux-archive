config HOTPLUG_PCI
	tristate "Support for PCI Hotplug (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on PCI && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you have a motherboard with a PCI Hotplug controller.
	  This allows you to add and remove PCI cards while the machine is
	  powered up and running.  The file system pcihpfs must be mounted
	  in order to interact with any PCI Hotplug controllers.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called pci_hotplug.

	  When in doubt, say N.

config HOTPLUG_PCI_FAKE
	tristate "Fake PCI Hotplug driver"
	depends on HOTPLUG_PCI
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use the fake PCI hotplug driver. It can
	  be used to simulate PCI hotplug events if even if your system is
	  not PCI hotplug capable.

	  This driver will "emulate" removing PCI devices from the system.
	  If the "power" file is written to with "0" then the specified PCI
	  device will be completely removed from the kernel.

	  WARNING, this does NOT turn off the power to the PCI device.
	  This is a "logical" removal, not a physical or electrical
	  removal.

	  Use this module at your own risk.  You have been warned!

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called fakephp.

	  When in doubt, say N.

config HOTPLUG_PCI_COMPAQ

	depends on HOTPLUG_PCI && X86 && PCI_BIOS
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a motherboard with a Compaq PCI Hotplug
	  controller.

	  When in doubt, say N.

config HOTPLUG_PCI_COMPAQ_NVRAM
	bool "Save configuration into NVRAM on Compaq servers"
	depends on HOTPLUG_PCI_COMPAQ
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a Compaq server that has a PCI Hotplug
	  controller.  This will allow the PCI Hotplug driver to store the PCI
	  system configuration options in NVRAM.

	  When in doubt, say N.
