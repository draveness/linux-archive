 *      High performance SCSI / Fibre Channel SCSI Host device driver.
 *      For use with PCI chip/adapter(s):
 *          LSIFC9xx/LSI409xx Fibre Channel
 *      running LSI Logic Fusion MPT (Message Passing Technology) firmware.
 *
 *  Credits:
 *      This driver would not exist if not for Alan Cox's development
 *      of the linux i2o driver.
 *
 *      A huge debt of gratitude is owed to David S. Miller (DaveM)
 *      for fixing much of the stupid and broken stuff in the early
 *      driver while porting to sparc64 platform.  THANK YOU!
