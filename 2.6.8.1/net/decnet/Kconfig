config DECNET_SIOCGIFCONF
	bool "DECnet: SIOCGIFCONF support"
	depends on DECNET
	help
	  This option should only be turned on if you are really sure that
	  you know what you are doing. It can break other applications which
	  use this system call and the proper way to get the information
	  provided by this call is to use rtnetlink.

	  If unsure, say N.

config DECNET_ROUTER
	bool "DECnet: router support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on DECNET && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  Add support for turning your DECnet Endnode into a level 1 or 2
	  router.  This is an experimental, but functional option.  If you
	  do say Y here, then make sure that you also say Y to "Kernel/User
	  network link driver", "Routing messages" and "Network packet
	  filtering".  The first two are required to allow configuration via
	  rtnetlink (you will need Alexey Kuznetsov's iproute2 package
	  from <ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/net/ip-routing/>). The "Network packet
	  filtering" option will be required for the forthcoming routing daemon
	  to work.

	  See <file:Documentation/networking/decnet.txt> for more information.

config DECNET_ROUTE_FWMARK
	bool "DECnet: use FWMARK value as routing key (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on DECNET_ROUTER && NETFILTER
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will be able to specify different routes for
	  packets with different FWMARK ("firewalling mark") values
	  (see ipchains(8), "-m" argument).
