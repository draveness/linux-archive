config BRIDGE_NF_EBTABLES
	tristate "Ethernet Bridge tables (ebtables) support"
	help
	  ebtables is a general, extensible frame/packet identification
	  framework. Say 'Y' or 'M' here if you want to do Ethernet
	  filtering/NAT/brouting on the Ethernet bridge.

# tables

config BRIDGE_EBT_BROUTE
	tristate "ebt: broute table support"
	depends on BRIDGE_NF_EBTABLES
	help
	  The ebtables broute table is used to define rules that decide between
	  bridging and routing frames, giving Linux the functionality of a
	  brouter. See the man page for ebtables(8) and examples on the ebtables
	  website.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config BRIDGE_EBT_T_FILTER
	tristate "ebt: filter table support"
	depends on BRIDGE_NF_EBTABLES
	help
	  The ebtables filter table is used to define frame filtering rules at
	  local input, forwarding and local output. See the man page for
	  ebtables(8).

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config BRIDGE_EBT_T_NAT
	tristate "ebt: nat table support"
	depends on BRIDGE_NF_EBTABLES
	help
	  The ebtables nat table is used to define rules that alter the MAC
	  source address (MAC SNAT) or the MAC destination address (MAC DNAT).
	  See the man page for ebtables(8).

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config BRIDGE_EBT_802_3
	tristate "ebt: 802.3 filter support"
	depends on BRIDGE_NF_EBTABLES
	help
	  This option adds matching support for 802.3 Ethernet frames.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config BRIDGE_EBT_AMONG
	tristate "ebt: among filter support"
	depends on BRIDGE_NF_EBTABLES
	help
	  This option adds the among match, which allows matching the MAC source
	  and/or destination address on a list of addresses. Optionally,
	  MAC/IP address pairs can be matched, f.e. for anti-spoofing rules.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config BRIDGE_EBT_ARP
	tristate "ebt: ARP filter support"
	depends on BRIDGE_NF_EBTABLES
	help
	  This option adds the ARP match, which allows ARP and RARP header field
	  filtering.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config BRIDGE_EBT_IP
	tristate "ebt: IP filter support"
	depends on BRIDGE_NF_EBTABLES
	help
	  This option adds the IP match, which allows basic IP header field
	  filtering.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config BRIDGE_EBT_LIMIT
	tristate "ebt: limit match support"
	depends on BRIDGE_NF_EBTABLES
	help
	  This option adds the limit match, which allows you to control
	  the rate at which a rule can be matched. This match is the
	  equivalent of the iptables limit match.

	  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt>.  If unsure, say `N'.

config BRIDGE_EBT_MARK
	tristate "ebt: mark filter support"
	depends on BRIDGE_NF_EBTABLES
	help
	  This option adds the mark match, which allows matching frames based on
	  the 'nfmark' value in the frame. This can be set by the mark target.
	  This value is the same as the one used in the iptables mark match and
	  target.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config BRIDGE_EBT_PKTTYPE
	tristate "ebt: packet type filter support"
	depends on BRIDGE_NF_EBTABLES
	help
	  This option adds the packet type match, which allows matching on the
	  type of packet based on its Ethernet "class" (as determined by
	  the generic networking code): broadcast, multicast,
	  for this host alone or for another host.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config BRIDGE_EBT_STP
	tristate "ebt: STP filter support"
	depends on BRIDGE_NF_EBTABLES
	help
	  This option adds the Spanning Tree Protocol match, which
	  allows STP header field filtering.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

	  automatically sending arp replies to arp requests.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config BRIDGE_EBT_DNAT
	tristate "ebt: dnat target support"
	depends on BRIDGE_NF_EBTABLES
