config IP_NF_CONNTRACK
	tristate "Connection tracking (required for masq/NAT)"
	---help---
	  Connection tracking keeps a record of what packets have passed
	  through your machine, in order to figure out how they are related
	  into connections.

	  This is required to do Masquerading or other kinds of Network
	  Address Translation (except for Fast NAT).  It can also be used to
	  enhance packet filtering (see `Connection state match support'
	  below).

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_FTP
	tristate "FTP protocol support"
	depends on IP_NF_CONNTRACK

config IP_NF_IRC
	tristate "IRC protocol support"
	depends on IP_NF_CONNTRACK
	---help---
	  There is a commonly-used extension to IRC called
	  Direct Client-to-Client Protocol (DCC).  This enables users to send
	  files to each other, and also chat to each other without the need
	  of a server.  DCC Sending is used anywhere you send files over IRC,
	  and DCC Chat is most commonly used by Eggdrop bots.  If you are
	  using NAT, this extension will enable you to send files and initiate
	  chats.  Note that you do NOT need this extension to get files or
	  have others initiate chats, or everything else in IRC.

	tristate "Multiple port match support"
	depends on IP_NF_IPTABLES

	depends on IP_NF_CONNTRACK && IP_NF_IPTABLES
	help
	  Connection state matching allows you to match packets based on their

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_MATCH_CONNTRACK
	tristate "Connection tracking match support"
	depends on IP_NF_CONNTRACK && IP_NF_IPTABLES

config IP_NF_MATCH_OWNER
	tristate "Owner match support"
	depends on IP_NF_IPTABLES

# The targets
config IP_NF_FILTER
	tristate "Packet filtering"
	depends on IP_NF_IPTABLES

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_TARGET_REJECT
	tristate "REJECT target support"
	depends on IP_NF_FILTER
	help
	  The REJECT target allows a filtering rule to specify that an ICMP

config IP_NF_NAT
	tristate "Full NAT"
	depends on IP_NF_IPTABLES && IP_NF_CONNTRACK

config IP_NF_TARGET_MASQUERADE
	tristate "MASQUERADE target support"
	depends on IP_NF_NAT
	help
	  Masquerading is a special case of NAT: all outgoing connections are
	  changed to seem to come from a particular interface's address, and
	  if the interface goes down, those connections are lost.  This is
	  only useful for dialup accounts with dynamic IP address (ie. your IP
	  address will be different on next dialup).

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_TARGET_REDIRECT
	tristate "REDIRECT target support"
	depends on IP_NF_NAT
	help
	  REDIRECT is a special case of NAT: all incoming connections are
	  mapped onto the incoming interface's address, causing the packets to
	  come to the local machine instead of passing through.  This is
	  useful for transparent proxies.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_TARGET_NETMAP
	tristate "NETMAP target support"
	depends on IP_NF_NAT
	help
	  NETMAP is an implementation of static 1:1 NAT mapping of network
	  addresses. It maps the network address part, while keeping the host
	  address part intact. It is similar to Fast NAT, except that
	  Netfilter's connection tracking doesn't work well with Fast NAT.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_TARGET_SAME
	tristate "SAME target support"
	depends on IP_NF_NAT
	help
	  This option adds a `SAME' target, which works like the standard SNAT
	  target, but attempts to give clients the same IP for all connections.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_NAT_LOCAL
	bool "NAT of local connections (READ HELP)"
	depends on IP_NF_NAT
	help
	  This option enables support for NAT of locally originated connections. 
	  Enable this if you need to use destination NAT on connections
	  originating from local processes on the nat box itself.

	  Please note that you will need a recent version (>= 1.2.6a)
	  of the iptables userspace program in order to use this feature.
	  See <http://www.iptables.org/> for download instructions.

	  If unsure, say 'N'.

config IP_NF_NAT_SNMP_BASIC
	tristate "Basic SNMP-ALG support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && IP_NF_NAT
	---help---

	  This module implements an Application Layer Gateway (ALG) for
	  SNMP payloads.  In conjunction with NAT, it allows a network
	  management system to access multiple private networks with
	  conflicting addresses.  It works by modifying IP addresses
	  inside SNMP payloads to match IP-layer NAT mapping.

	  This is the "basic" form of SNMP-ALG, as described in RFC 2962

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_MANGLE
	tristate "Packet mangling"
	depends on IP_NF_IPTABLES
	help
	  This option adds a `mangle' table to iptables: see the man page for

	  which can effect how the packet is routed.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_TARGET_TOS
	tristate "TOS target support"
	depends on IP_NF_MANGLE
	help
	  This option adds a `TOS' target, which allows you to create rules in

config IP_NF_TARGET_ECN
	tristate "ECN target support"
	depends on IP_NF_MANGLE
	---help---
	  This option adds a `ECN' target, which can be used in the iptables mangle
	  table.  

	  You can use this target to remove the ECN bits from the IPv4 header of
	  an IP packet.  This is particularly useful, if you need to work around
	  existing ECN blackholes on the internet, but don't want to disable
	  ECN support in general.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_TARGET_DSCP
	tristate "DSCP target support"
	depends on IP_NF_MANGLE
	help
	  This option adds a `DSCP' match, which allows you to match against

config IP_NF_TARGET_MARK
	tristate "MARK target support"
	depends on IP_NF_MANGLE
	help
	  This option adds a `MARK' target, which allows you to create rules
	  in the `mangle' table which alter the netfilter mark (nfmark) field
	  associated with the packet prior to routing. This can change
	  the routing method (see `Use netfilter MARK value as routing
	  key') and can also be used by other subsystems to change their
	  behavior.

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_TARGET_CLASSIFY
	tristate "CLASSIFY target support"
	depends on IP_NF_MANGLE
	help
	  This option adds a `CLASSIFY' target, which enables the user to set
	  the priority of a packet. Some qdiscs can use this value for
	  classification, among these are:

  	  atm, cbq, dsmark, pfifo_fast, htb, prio

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_TARGET_LOG
	tristate "LOG target support"
	depends on IP_NF_IPTABLES
	help
	  This option adds a `LOG' target, which allows you to create rules in

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here.  If unsure, say N.

config IP_NF_TARGET_ULOG
	tristate "ULOG target support"
	depends on IP_NF_IPTABLES
	---help---
	  This option adds a `ULOG' target, which allows you to create rules in
	  any iptables table. The packet is passed to a userspace logging
	  daemon using netlink multicast sockets; unlike the LOG target
	  which can only be viewed through syslog.

	  The apropriate userspace logging daemon (ulogd) may be obtained from
	  <http://www.gnumonks.org/projects/ulogd/>

config IP_NF_TARGET_TCPMSS
	tristate "TCPMSS target support"
	depends on IP_NF_IPTABLES
	---help---
	  This option adds a `TCPMSS' target, which allows you to alter the
	  MSS value of TCP SYN packets, to control the maximum size for that
	  connection (usually limiting it to your outgoing interface's MTU
	  minus 40).

	  This is used to overcome criminally braindead ISPs or servers which
	  block ICMP Fragmentation Needed packets.  The symptoms of this
	  problem are that everything works fine from your Linux
	  firewall/router, but machines behind it can never exchange large
	  packets:
	  	1) Web browsers connect, then hang with no data received.
	  	2) Small mail works fine, but large emails hang.
	  	3) ssh works fine, but scp hangs after initial handshaking.

	  Workaround: activate this option and add a rule to your firewall
	  configuration like:

	  iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN \
	  		 -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu
