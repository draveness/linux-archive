     <title>Thanks</title>
  <para>
  The bulk of the ATA knowledge comes thanks to long conversations with
  Andre Hedrick (www.linux-ide.org).
  </para>
  <para>
  Thanks to Alan Cox for pointing out similarities 
  between SATA and SCSI, and in general for motivation to hack on
  libata.
  </para>
  <para>
  libata's device detection
  method, ata_pio_devchk, and in general all the early probing was
  based on extensive study of Hale Landis's probe/reset code in his
  ATADRVR driver (www.ata-atapi.com).
