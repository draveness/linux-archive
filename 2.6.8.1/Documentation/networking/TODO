To-do items for network drivers
-------------------------------

* Move ethernet crc routine to generic code

* (for 2.5) Integrate Jamal Hadi Salim's netdev Rx polling API change

* Audit all net drivers to make sure magic packet / wake-on-lan /
  similar features are disabled in the driver by default.

* Audit all net drivers to make sure the module always prints out a
  version string when loaded as a module, but only prints a version
  string when built into the kernel if a device is detected.

* Add ETHTOOL_GDRVINFO ioctl support to all ethernet drivers.

* dmfe PCI DMA is totally wrong and only works on x86
