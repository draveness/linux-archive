		Advanced Linux Sound Architecture - Driver
		==========================================
			    Configuration guide


Kernel Configuration
====================

To enable the ALSA support, at least you need to build the kernel with
the primary sound card support (CONFIG_SOUND).  Since ALSA can emulate
the OSS, you don't have to choose any of the OSS/Free modules.  Please
enable "OSS API emulation" (CONFIG_SND_OSSEMUL) and both OSS mixer and
PCM supports if you want to run the OSS application with the ALSA.

When you want to support the WaveTable functionality on some cards
such like SB Live!, you need to enable "Sequencer support"
(CONFIG_SND_SEQUENCER).

For getting more verbose debug messages, turn on "Verbose printk" and
"Debug" options.  For checking the memory leaks, you can turn on
"Debug memory" option, too.  "Debug detection" will put more
additional checks for the detection of cards.

Please note that all the ALSA ISA drivers support Linux isapnp API (if
the card supports).  You don't need to configure the PnP via
isapnptools.


Creating ALSA devices
=====================

Use the /dev/MAKEDEV script to create the nessecary device nodes.


Module parameters
=================

  A user can modify or set parameters at the load time of the module. If
  the module supports more cards and you have got more than one card
  of the same type, you may simply specify more values for the parameter,
  delimited by commas.
  
  Note that module option names were changed in 0.9.0rc4. The 'snd_'
  prefix was removed.

  Module snd
  ----------

    The module snd is the ALSA core module, which is used by all ALSA
    card drivers.  This takes the global options for creating devices,
    etc.

    major	- major # for sound driver
		- default is 116
    cards_limit
		- specifies card limit # for auto-loading (1-8)
		- default is 1
		- for auto-loading more than 1 card, specify this option
		  together with snd-card-X aliases.
    device_mode
		- specifies permission mask for dynamic sound device filesystem
		  (available only when DEVFS is enabled)
		- default value = 0666
		- for example 'device_mode=0660'

  
  Module snd-pcm-oss
  ------------------

    The PCM OSS emulation module.
    This module takes the options to change the mapping of devices.

    dsp_map	- PCM device number maps assigned to the 1st OSS device.
		  (default: 0)
    adsp_map	- PCM device number maps assigned to the 2st OSS device.
		  (default: 1)
    nonblock_open - Don't block opening busy PCM devices.

    For example, when dsp_map=2, /dev/dsp will be mapped to PCM #2 of
    the card #0.  Similarly, when adsp_map=0, /dev/adsp will be mapped
    to PCM #0 of the card #0.
    For changing the second or later card, specify the option with
    commas, such like "dsp_map=0,1".

    nonblock_open option is used to change the behavior of the PCM
    regarding opening the device.  When this option is non-zero,
    opening a busy OSS PCM device won't be blocked but return
    immediately with EAGAIN (just like O_NONBLOCK flag).
    
  Module snd-rawmidi
  ------------------

    This module takes the options to change the mapping of OSS
    devices like snd-pcm-oss module.

    midi_map	- MIDI device number maps assigned to the 1st OSS device.
		  (default: 0)
    amidi_map	- MIDI device number maps assigned to the 2st OSS device.
		  (default: 1)

  Common parameters for top soundcard modules
  -------------------------------------------

    Each of top-level soundcard module takes some general options,

    index	- 0-7 - index (slot #) for soundcard
                - if not set or -1, first free index (slot #) is assigned
    id		- user identification for card (up to 15 chars)
		- default expression is 'card<index>' (for example card1)
		- value is used for /proc/asound filesystem
		- this value can be used by applications for identification
		  of card if user does not want identify card with index number
    enable  	- enable card.  (all cards enabled for PCI and ISA PnP cards
		  as default.)

    playback_bufsize - max playback frame size in kB (4-128kB)
    capture_bufsize  - max capture frame size in kB (4-128kB)
    force_ac97       - 0 or 1 (disabled by default)
    buffer_top       - specify buffer top address
    use_cache        - 0 or 1 (disabled by default)
    vaio_hack        - alias buffer_top=0x25a800

    Module supports autoprobe and multiple chips (max 8).

    The power-management is supported.

    Note: on some notebooks the buffer address cannot be detected
    automatically, or causes hang-up during initialization.
    In such a case, specify the buffer top address explicity via
    buffer_top option.
    For example,
      Sony F250: buffer_top=0x25a800
      Sony F270: buffer_top=0x272800
    The driver supports only ac97 codec.  It's possible to force
    to initialize/use ac97 although it's not detected.  In such a
    case, use force_ac97=1 option - but *NO* guarantee whether it
    works!

    Note: The NM256 chip can be linked internally with non-AC97
    codecs.  This driver supports only the AC97 codec, and won't work
    with machines with other (most likely CS423x or OPL3SAx) chips,
    even though the device is detected in lspci.  In such a case, try
    other drivers, e.g. snd-cs4232 or snd-opl3sa2.  Some has ISA-PnP
    but some doesn't have ISA PnP.  You'll need to speicfy isapnp=0
    and proper hardware parameters in the case without ISA PnP.

    Note: This driver is really crappy.  It's a porting from the
    OSS driver, which is a result of black-magic reverse engineering.
    The detection of codec will fail if the driver is loaded *after*
    X-server as described above.  You might be able to force to load
    the module, but it may result in hang-up.   Hence, make sure that
    you load this module *before* X if you encounter this kind of
    problem.

    mpu_port	- 0x300,0x310,0x320,0x330, otherwise obtain BIOS setup
		  [VIA686A/686B only]
    joystick	- Enable joystick (default off) [VIA686A/686B only]
    ac97_clock	- AC'97 codec clock base (default 48000Hz)
    dxs_support	- support DXS channels,
		  0 = auto (defalut), 1 = enable, 2 = disable,
		  3 = 48k only, 4 = no VRA
		  [VIA8233/C,8235 only]
    ac97_quirk  - AC'97 workaround for strange hardware
                  See the description of intel8x0 module for details.

    Module supports autoprobe and multiple bus-master chips (max 8).

    Note: on some SMP motherboards like MSI 694D the interrupts might
          not be generated properly.  In such a case, please try to
          set the SMP (or MPS) version on BIOS to 1.1 instead of
          default value 1.4.  Then the interrupt number will be
          assigned under 15. You might also upgrade your BIOS.
    
    Note: VIA8233/5 (not VIA8233A) can support DXS (direct sound)
	  channels as the first PCM.  On these channels, up to 4
	  streams can be played at the same time.
	  As default (dxs_support = 0), 48k fixed rate is chosen
	  except for the known devices since the output is often
	  noisy except for 48k on some mother boards due to the
	  bug of BIOS.
	  Please try once dxs_support=1 and if it works on other
	  sample rates (e.g. 44.1kHz of mp3 playback), please let us
	  know the PCI subsystem vendor/device id's (output of
	  "lspci -nv").
	  If it doesn't work, try dxs_support=4.  If it still doesn't
	  work and the default setting is ok, dxs_support=3 is the
	  right choice.  If the default setting doesn't work at all,
	  try dxs_support=2 to disable the DXS channels.
	  In any cases, please let us know the result and the
	  subsystem vendor/device ids.

    Note: for the MPU401 on VIA823x, use snd-mpu401 driver
	  additonally.  The mpu_port option is for VIA686 chips only.

  Module snd-virmidi
  ------------------

    Module for virtual rawmidi devices.
    This module creates virtual rawmidi devices which communicate
    to the corresponding ALSA sequencer ports.

    midi_devs	- MIDI devices # (1-8, default=4)
    
    Module supports up to 8 cards.

  Module snd-vx222
  ----------------

    Module for Digigram VX-Pocket VX222, V222 v2 and Mic cards.

    mic		- Enable Microphone on V222 Mic (NYI)
    ibl		- Capture IBL size. (default = 0, minimum size)

    Module supports up to 8 cards.

    For loading the firmware, use vxloader utility in alsa-tools
    and alsa-firmware packages.  You can load the firmware automatically
    by adding the following to /etc/modprobe.conf

	install snd-vx222 /sbin/modprobe --first-time -i snd-vx222 && /usr/bin/vxloader

    (for 2.2/2.4 kernels, add "post-install /usr/bin/vxloader" to
     /etc/modules.conf, instead.)
    IBL size defines the interrupts period for PCM.  The smaller size
    gives smaller latency but leads to more CPU consumption, too.
    The size is usually aligned to 126.  As default (=0), the smallest
    size is chosen.  The possible IBL values can be found in
    /proc/asound/cardX/vx-status proc file.

  Module snd-vxpocket
  -------------------

    Module for Digigram VX-Pocket VX2 PCMCIA card.

    irq_mask - IRQ bitmask, specifies the available IRQs as bits
               (default = 0xffff, all available)
    irq_list - List of available interrupts (default = -1, not specified)
               4 numbers must be given (if specified).
    ibl      - Capture IBL size. (default = 0, minimum size)

    Module supports up to 8 cards.  The module is compiled only when
    PCMCIA is supported on kernel.

    To activate the driver via the card manager, you'll need to set
    up /etc/pcmcia/vxpocket.conf.  See the sound/pcmcia/vx/vxpocket.c.

    For loading the firmware, use vxloader utility in alsa-tools
    and alsa-firmware packages.

    The irq_mask and irq_list are provided to avoid allocation of
    specific IRQs.  Usually you don't need to specify them.

    About capture IBL, see the description of snd-vx222 module.

    Note: the driver is build only when CONFIG_ISA is set.
    
  Module snd-vxp440

    irq_list - List of available interrupts (default = -1, not specified)
               4 numbers must be given (if specified).
    ibl      - Capture IBL size. (default = 0, minimum size)

    Module supports up to 8 cards.  The module is compiled only when
    PCMCIA is supported on kernel.

    To activate the driver via the card manager, you'll need to set
    up /etc/pcmcia/vxp440.conf.  See the sound/pcmcia/vx/vxp440.c.

    Module for Sound Core PDAudioCF soundcard.

    irq_mask	  - IRQ mask (PCMCIA type)
    irq_list	  - List of available interrupts for this soundcard

    Note: the driver is build only when CONFIG_ISA is set.


Configuring Non-ISAPNP Cards
============================

When the kernel is configured with ISA-PnP support, the modules
supporting the isapnp cards will have module options "isapnp".
If this option is set, *only* the ISA-PnP devices will be probed.
For probing the non ISA-PnP cards, you have to pass "isapnp=0" option
together with the proper i/o and irq configuration.

When the kernel is configured without ISA-PnP support, isapnp option
will be not built in.


Module Autoloading Support
==========================

The ALSA drivers can be loaded automatically on demand by defining
module aliases.  The string 'snd-card-%1' is requested for ALSA native
devices where %i is soundcard number from zero to seven.

To auto-load an ALSA driver for OSS services, define the string
'sound-slot-%i' where %i means the slot number for OSS, which
corresponds to the card index of ALSA.  Usually, define this
as the the same card module.

An example configuration for a single emu10k1 card is like below:
----- /etc/modprobe.conf
alias snd-card-0 snd-emu10k1
alias sound-slot-0 snd-emu10k1
----- /etc/modprobe.conf

The available number of auto-loaded soundcards depends on the module
option "cards_limit" of snd module.  As default it's set to 1.
To enable the auto-loading of multiple cards, specify the number of
soundcards in that option.

When multiple cards are available, it'd better to specify the index
number for each card via module option, too, so that the order of
cards is kept consistent.

An example configuration for two soundcards is like below:

----- /etc/modprobe.conf
# ALSA portion
options snd cards_limit=2
alias snd-card-0 snd-interwave
alias snd-card-1 snd-ens1371
options snd-interwave index=0
options snd-ens1371 index=1
# OSS/Free portion
alias sound-slot-0 snd-interwave
alias sound-slot-1 snd-ens1371
----- /etc/moprobe.conf

In this example, the interwave card is always loaded as the first card
(index 0) and ens1371 as the second (index 1).


ALSA PCM devices to OSS devices mapping
=======================================

/dev/snd/pcmC0D0  -> /dev/audio0 (/dev/audio) -> minor 4
/dev/snd/pcmC0D0  -> /dev/dsp0 (/dev/dsp)     -> minor 3
/dev/snd/pcmC0D1  -> /dev/adsp0 (/dev/adsp)   -> minor 12
/dev/snd/pcmC1D0  -> /dev/audio1              -> minor 4+16 = 20
/dev/snd/pcmC1D0  -> /dev/dsp1                -> minor 3+16 = 19
/dev/snd/pcmC1D1  -> /dev/adsp1               -> minor 12+16 = 28
/dev/snd/pcmC2D0  -> /dev/audio2              -> minor 4+32 = 36
/dev/snd/pcmC2D0  -> /dev/dsp2                -> minor 3+32 = 39
/dev/snd/pcmC2D1  -> /dev/adsp2               -> minor 12+32 = 44

The first number from /dev/snd/pcmC{X}D{Y} expression means soundcard number
and second means device number.
Please note that the device mapping above may be varied via the module
options of snd-pcm-oss module.


DEVFS support
=============

The ALSA driver fully supports the devfs extension.
You should add lines below to your devfsd.conf file:

LOOKUP snd MODLOAD ACTION snd
REGISTER ^sound/.* PERMISSIONS root.audio 660
REGISTER ^snd/.* PERMISSIONS root.audio 660

Warning: These lines assume that you have the audio group in your system.
         Otherwise replace audio word with another group name (root for
         example).


Proc interfaces (/proc/asound)
==============================

/proc/asound/card#/pcm#[cp]/oss
-------------------------------
  String "erase" - erase all additional informations about OSS applications
  String "<app_name> <fragments> <fragment_size> [<options>]"

   <app_name> - name of application with (higher priority) or without path
   <fragments> - number of fragments or zero if auto
   <fragment_size> - size of fragment in bytes or zero if auto
   <options> - optional parameters
	  - disable   the application tries to open a pcm device for
		      this channel but does not want to use it.
		      (Cause a bug or mmap needs)
		      It's good for Quake etc...
	  - direct    don't use plugins
	  - block     force block mode (rvplayer)
	  - non-block force non-block mode
	  - whole-frag  write only whole fragments (optimization affecting
			playback only)
	  - no-silence  do not fill silence ahead to avoid clicks

  Example: echo "x11amp 128 16384" > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss
           echo "squake 0 0 disable" > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0c/oss
	   echo "rvplayer 0 0 block" > /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/oss
