USING UFS
=========

mount -t ufs -o ufstype=type_of_ufs device dir


UFS OPTIONS
===========

ufstype=type_of_ufs
	UFS is a file system widely used in different operating systems.
	The problem are differences among implementations. Features of
	some implementations are undocumented, so its hard to recognize
	type of ufs automatically. That's why user must specify type of 
	ufs manually by mount option ufstype. Possible values are:

	old	old format of ufs
		default value, supported os read-only

	44bsd	used in FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD
		supported os read-write

       ufs2    used in FreeBSD 5.x
               supported os read-only

	sun	used in SunOS (Solaris)
		supported as read-write

	sunx86	used in SunOS for Intel (Solarisx86)
		supported as read-write

	nextstep
		used in NextStep
		supported as read-only

	nextstep-cd
		used for NextStep CDROMs (block_size == 2048)
		supported as read-only

	openstep
		used in OpenStep
		supported as read-only


POSSIBLE PROBLEMS
=================

There is still bug in reallocation of fragment, in file fs/ufs/balloc.c, 
line 364. But it seem working on current buffer cache configuration.
