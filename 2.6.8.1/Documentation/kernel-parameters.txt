February 2003             Kernel Parameters                     v2.5.59
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is a consolidated list of the kernel parameters as implemented
(mostly) by the __setup() macro and sorted into English Dictionary order
(defined as ignoring all punctuation and sorting digits before letters in a
case insensitive manner), and with descriptions where known.

Module parameters for loadable modules are specified only as the
parameter name with optional '=' and value as appropriate, such as:

	modprobe usbcore blinkenlights=1

Module parameters for modules that are built into the kernel image
are specified on the kernel command line with the module name plus
'.' plus parameter name, with '=' and value if appropriate, such as:

	usbcore.blinkenlights=1

The text in square brackets at the beginning of the description state the
restrictions on the kernel for the said kernel parameter to be valid. The
restrictions referred to are that the relevant option is valid if:

	ACPI	ACPI support is enabled.
	ALSA	ALSA sound support is enabled.
	APIC	APIC support is enabled.
	APM	Advanced Power Management support is enabled.
	AX25	Appropriate AX.25 support is enabled.
	CD	Appropriate CD support is enabled.
	DEVFS	devfs support is enabled. 
	DRM	Direct Rendering Management support is enabled. 
	EFI	EFI Partitioning (GPT) is enabled
	EIDE	EIDE/ATAPI support is enabled.
	FB	The frame buffer device is enabled.
	HW	Appropriate hardware is enabled.
	IA-32	IA-32 aka i386 architecture is enabled.
	IA-64	IA-64 architecture is enabled.
	IOSCHED	More than one I/O scheduler is enabled.
	IP_PNP	IP DCHP, BOOTP, or RARP is enabled.
	ISAPNP	ISA PnP code is enabled.
	ISDN	Appropriate ISDN support is enabled.
	JOY	Appropriate joystick support is enabled.
	LP	Printer support is enabled.
	LOOP	Loopback device support is enabled.
	M68k	M68k architecture is enabled.
			These options have more detailed description inside of
			Documentation/m68k/kernel-options.txt.
	MCA	MCA bus support is enabled.
	MDA	MDA console support is enabled.
	MOUSE	Appropriate mouse support is enabled.
	MTD	MTD support is enabled.
	NET	Appropriate network support is enabled.
	NFS	Appropriate NFS support is enabled.
	OSS	OSS sound support is enabled.
	PARIDE	The ParIDE subsystem is enabled.
	PCI	PCI bus support is enabled.
	PCMCIA	The PCMCIA subsystem is enabled.
	PNP	Plug & Play support is enabled.
	PPC	PowerPC architecture is enabled.
	PPT	Parallel port support is enabled.
	PS2	Appropriate PS/2 support is enabled.
	RAM	RAM disk support is enabled.
	S390	S390 architecture is enabled.
	SCSI	Appropriate SCSI support is enabled.
			A lot of drivers has their options described inside of
			Documentation/scsi/.
	SERIAL	Serial support is enabled.
	SMP	The kernel is an SMP kernel.
	SPARC	Sparc architecture is enabled.
	SWSUSP	Software suspension is enabled.
	TS	Appropriate touchscreen support is enabled.
	USB	USB support is enabled.
	V4L	Video For Linux support is enabled.
	VGA	The VGA console has been enabled.
	VT	Virtual terminal support is enabled.
	WDT	Watchdog support is enabled.
	XT	IBM PC/XT MFM hard disk support is enabled.

In addition, the following text indicates that the option:

	BUGS=	Relates to possible processor bugs on the said processor.
	KNL	Is a kernel start-up parameter.
	BOOT	Is a boot loader parameter.

Parameters denoted with BOOT are actually interpreted by the boot
loader, and have no meaning to the kernel directly.
Do not modify the syntax of boot loader parameters without extreme
need or coordination with <Documentation/i386/boot.txt>.

Note that ALL kernel parameters listed below are CASE SENSITIVE, and that
a trailing = on the name of any parameter states that that parameter will
be entered as an environment variable, whereas its absence indicates that
it will appear as a kernel argument readable via /proc/cmdline by programs
running once the system is up.

	lp=auto			printer driver. 'lp=reset' (which can be
				specified in addition to the ports) causes
				attached printers to be reset. Using
				lp=port1,port2,... specifies the parallel ports
				to associate lp devices with, starting with
				lp0. A port specification may be 'none' to skip
				that lp device, or a parport name such as
				'parport0'. Specifying 'lp=auto' instead of a
				port specification list means that device IDs
				from each port should be examined, to see if
				an IEEE 1284-compliant printer is attached; if
				so, the driver will manage that printer.

	parport=0	[HW,PPT]	Specify parallel ports. 0 disables.
	parport=auto			Use 'auto' to force the driver to use
	parport=0xBBB[,IRQ[,DMA]]	any IRQ/DMA settings detected (the
					default is to ignore detected IRQ/DMA
					settings because of possible
					conflicts). You can specify the base
					address, IRQ, and DMA settings; IRQ and
					DMA should be numbers, or 'auto' (for
					using detected settings on that
					particular port), or 'nofifo' (to avoid
					using a FIFO even if it is detected).
					Parallel ports are assigned in the
					order they are specified on the command
					line, starting with parport0.

	pci=option[,option...]		[PCI] various PCI subsystem options:
		off			[IA-32] don't probe for the PCI bus
		bios			[IA-32] force use of PCI BIOS, don't access
					the hardware directly. Use this if your machine
					has a non-standard PCI host bridge.
		nobios			[IA-32] disallow use of PCI BIOS, only direct
					hardware access methods are allowed. Use this
					if you experience crashes upon bootup and you
					suspect they are caused by the BIOS.
		conf1			[IA-32] Force use of PCI Configuration Mechanism 1.
		conf2			[IA-32] Force use of PCI Configuration Mechanism 2.
		nosort			[IA-32] Don't sort PCI devices according to
					order given by the PCI BIOS. This sorting is done
					to get a device order compatible with older kernels.
		biosirq			[IA-32] Use PCI BIOS calls to get the interrupt
					routing table. These calls are known to be buggy
					on several machines and they hang the machine when used,
					but on other computers it's the only way to get the
					interrupt routing table. Try this option if the kernel
					is unable to allocate IRQs or discover secondary PCI
					buses on your motherboard.
		rom			[IA-32] Assign address space to expansion ROMs.
					Use with caution as certain devices share address
					decoders between ROMs and other resources.
		irqmask=0xMMMM		[IA-32] Set a bit mask of IRQs allowed to be assigned
					automatically to PCI devices. You can make the kernel
					exclude IRQs of your ISA cards this way.
		lastbus=N		[IA-32] Scan all buses till bus #N. Can be useful
					if the kernel is unable to find your secondary buses
					and you want to tell it explicitly which ones they are.
		assign-busses		[IA-32] Always assign all PCI bus
					numbers ourselves, overriding
					whatever the firmware may have
					done.
		usepirqmask		[IA-32] Honor the possible IRQ mask
					stored in the BIOS $PIR table. This is
					needed on some systems with broken
					BIOSes, notably some HP Pavilion N5400
					and Omnibook XE3 notebooks. This will
					have no effect if ACPI IRQ routing is
					enabled.
		noacpi			[IA-32] Do not use ACPI for IRQ routing
					or for PCI scanning.
