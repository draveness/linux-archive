Linux 2.6.x on MPC52xx family
-----------------------------

For the latest info, go to http://www.246tNt.com/mpc52xx/state.txt
 
To compile/use :

  - U-Boot:
     # <edit Makefile to set ARCH=ppc & CROSS_COMPILE=... ( also EXTRAVERSION
        if you wish to ).
     # make lite5200_defconfig
     # make uImage
    
     then, on U-boot:
     => tftpboot 200000 uImage
     => tftpboot 400000 pRamdisk
     => bootm 200000 400000
    
  - DBug:
     # <edit Makefile to set ARCH=ppc & CROSS_COMPILE=... ( also EXTRAVERSION
        if you wish to ).
     # make lite5200_defconfig
     # cp your_initrd.gz arch/ppc/boot/images/ramdisk.image.gz
     # make zImage.initrd 
     # make 

     then in DBug:
     DBug> dn -i zImage.initrd.lite5200
     

Some remarks :
 - The port is named mpc52xxx, and config options are PPC_MPC52xx. The MGT5100
   is not supported, and I'm not sure anyone is interesting in working on it
   so. I didn't took 5xxx because there's apparently a lot of 5xxx that have
   nothing to do with the MPC5200. I also included the 'MPC' for the same
   reason.
 - Of course, I inspired myself from the 2.4 port. If you think I forgot to
   mention you/your company in the copyright of some code, I'll correct it
   ASAP.
 - The codes wants the MBAR to be set at 0xf0000000 by the bootloader. It's
   mapped 1:1 with the MMU. If for whatever reason, you want to change this,
   beware that some code depends on the 0xf0000000 address and other depends
   on the 1:1 mapping.
 - Most of the code assumes that port multiplexing, frequency selection, ...
   has already been done. IMHO this should be done as early as possible, in
   the bootloader. If for whatever reason you can't do it there, do it in the
   platform setup code (if U-Boot) or in the arch/ppc/boot/simple/... (if
   DBug)
