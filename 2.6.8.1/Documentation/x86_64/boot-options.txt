AMD64 specific boot options

There are many others (usually documented in driver documentation), but
only the AMD64 specific ones are listed here.

Machine check

   mce=off disable machine check

   nomce (for compatibility with i386): same as mce=off

   Everything else is in sysfs now.

APICs

   apic		 Use IO-APIC. Default
		 Unless you have an NVidia or VIA/Uniprocessor board.
		Then it defaults to off.

   noapic	 Don't use the IO-APIC.

   disableapic	 Don't use the local APIC

   nolapic	 Don't use the local APIC (alias for i386 compatibility)

   pirq=...	 See Documentation/i386/IO-APIC.txt

Early Console

   syntax: earlyprintk=vga
           earlyprintk=serial[,ttySn[,baudrate]]

   The early console is useful when the kernel crashes before the
   normal console is initialized. It is not enabled by
   default because it has some cosmetic problems.
   Append ,keep to not disable it when the real console takes over.
   Only vga or serial at a time, not both.
   Currently only ttyS0 and ttyS1 are supported.
   Interaction with the standard serial driver is not very good.
   The VGA output is eventually overwritten by the real console.

Timing

  notsc
  Don't use the CPU time stamp counter to read the wall time.
  This can be used to work around timing problems on multiprocessor systems
  with not properly synchronized CPUs. Only useful with a SMP kernel

  report_lost_ticks
  Report when timer interrupts are lost because some code turned off
  interrupts for too long.

  nmi_watchdog=NUMBER[,panic]
  NUMBER can be:
  0 don't use an NMI watchdog
  1 use the IO-APIC timer for the NMI watchdog
  2 use the local APIC for the NMI watchdog using a performance counter. Note
  This will use one performance counter and the local APIC's performance
  vector.
  When panic is specified panic when an NMI watchdog timeout occurs.
  This is useful when you use a panic=... timeout and need the box
  quickly up again.

Idle loop

  idle=poll
  Don't do power saving in the idle loop using HLT, but poll for rescheduling
  event. This will make the CPUs eat a lot more power, but may be useful
  to get slightly better performance in multiprocessor benchmarks. It also
  makes some profiling using performance counters more accurate.

Rebooting

   reboot=b[ios] | t[riple] | k[bd] [, [w]arm | [c]old]
   bios	  Use the CPU reboto vector for warm reset
   warm   Don't set the cold reboot flag
   cold   Set the cold reboto flag
   triple Force a triple fault (init)
   kbd    Use the keyboard controller. cold reset (default)

   Using warm reset will be much faster especially on big memory
   systems because the BIOS will not go through the memory check.
   Disadvantage is that not all hardware will be completely reinitialized
   on reboot so there may be boot problems on some systems.

Non Executable Mappings

  noexec=on|off

  on      Enable
  off     Disable
  noforce (default) Don't enable by default for heap/stack/data,
          but allow PROT_EXEC to be effective

  noexec32=opt{,opt}

  Control the no exec default for 32bit processes.
  Requires noexec=on or noexec=noforce to be effective.

  Valid options:
     all,on    Heap,stack,data is non executable.
     off       (default) Heap,stack,data is executable
     stack     Stack is non executable, heap/data is.
     force     Don't imply PROT_EXEC for PROT_READ
     compat    (default) Imply PROT_EXEC for PROT_READ

SMP

  nosmp	Only use a single CPU

  maxcpus=NUMBER only use upto NUMBER CPUs

  cpumask=MASK   only use cpus with bits set in mask

NUMA

  numa=off	Only set up a single NUMA node spanning all memory.


ACPI

  acpi=off	Don't enable ACPI
  acpi=ht	Use ACPI boot table parsing, but don't enable ACPI
		interpreter
  acpi=force	Force ACPI on (currently not needed)

PCI

  pci=off	Don't use PCI
  pci=conf1	Use conf1 access.
  pci=conf2	Use conf2 access.
  pci=rom	Assign ROMs.
  pci=assign-busses    Assign busses
  pci=irqmask=MASK	       Set PCI interrupt mask to MASK
  pci=lastbus=NUMBER	       Scan upto NUMBER busses, no matter what the mptable says.

IOMMU

  iommu=[size][,noagp][,off][,force][,noforce][,leak][,memaper[=order]][,soft]
   size  set size of iommu (in bytes)
   noagp don't initialize the AGP driver and use full aperture.
   off   don't use the IOMMU
   leak  turn on simple iommu leak tracing (only when CONFIG_IOMMU_LEAK is on)
   memaper[=order] allocate an own aperture over RAM with size 32MB^order.
   noforce don't force IOMMU usage. Default.
   force  Force IOMMU
   soft   Use software bounce buffering for non 32bit IO. Default on Intel
          machines. 

  swiotlb=pages

  Prereserve that many 4K pages for the software IO bounce buffering.
