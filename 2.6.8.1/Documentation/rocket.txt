Comtrol(tm) RocketPort(R)/RocketModem(TM) Series 
Device Driver for the Linux Operating System

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

PRODUCT OVERVIEW
----------------

This driver provides a loadable kernel driver for the Comtrol RocketPort
and RocketModem PCI boards. These boards provide, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 
high-speed serial ports or modems.  This driver supports up to a combination
of four RocketPort or RocketModems boards in one machine simultaneously.
This file assumes that you are using the RocketPort driver which is
integrated into the kernel sources.  

The driver can also be installed as an external module using the usual 
"make;make install" routine.  This external module driver, obtainable 
from the Comtrol website listed below, is useful for updating the driver
or installing it into kernels which do not have the driver configured
into them.  Installations instructions for the external module
are in the included README and HW_INSTALL files.

RocketPort ISA and RocketModem II PCI boards are also supported by this
driver, but must use the external module driver for configuration reasons.

INSTALLATION PROCEDURES
-----------------------

RocketPort/RocketModem PCI cards require no driver configuration, they are 
automatically detected and configured.

The RocketPort driver can be installed as a module (recommended) or built 
into the kernel. This is selected, as for other drivers, through the `make config`
command from the root of the Linux source tree during the kernel build process. 

The RocketPort/RocketModem serial ports installed by this driver are assigned
device major number 46, and will be named /dev/ttyRx, where x is the port number 
starting at zero (ex. /dev/ttyR0, /devttyR1, ...).  If you have multiple cards
installed in the system, the mapping of port names to serial ports is displayed
in the system log at /var/log/messages.

If installed as a module, the module must be loaded.  This can be done
manually by entering "modprobe rocket".  To have the module loaded automatically
upon system boot, edit the /etc/modprobe.conf file and add the line
"alias char-major-46 rocket".

In order to use the ports, their device names (nodes) must be created with mknod.
This is only required once, the system will retain the names once created.  To 
create the RocketPort/RocketModem device names, use the command 
"mknod /dev/ttyRx c 46 x" where x is the port number starting at zero.  For example:

>mknod /dev/ttyR0 c 46 0
>mknod /dev/ttyR1 c 46 1
>mknod /dev/ttyR2 c 46 2  

The Linux script MAKEDEV will create the first 16 ttyRx device names (nodes) for you:

>/dev/MAKEDEV ttyR

For technical support, please provide the following
information: Driver version, kernel release, distribution of
kernel, and type of board you are using. Error messages and log
printouts port configuration details are especially helpful.
