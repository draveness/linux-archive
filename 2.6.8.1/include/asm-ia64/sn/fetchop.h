 * be a cached entry with the memory type bits all set.  This address
 * may be loaded into processor cache.  The AMO_t will be referenced
 * uncached via the memory special memory type.  If any portion of the
 * cached cache-line is modified, when that line is flushed, it will
 * overwrite the uncached value in physical memory and lead to
