/*
 * Junk Bus Address Space
 *   The junk bus is used to access the PROM, LED's, and UART. It's 
 *   accessed through the local block MMR space. The data path is
 *   16 bits wide. This space requires address bits 31-27 to be set, and
 *   is further divided by address bits 26:15.
 *   The LED addresses are write-only. To read the LEDs, you need to use
 *   SH_JUNK_BUS_LED0-3, defined in shub_mmr.h
 *
