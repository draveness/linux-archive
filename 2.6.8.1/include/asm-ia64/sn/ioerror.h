/*
 * List of errors to be handled by each subsystem.
 * "error_code" field will take one of these values.
 * The error code is built up of single bits expressing
 * our confidence that the error was that type; note
 * that it is possible to have a PIO or DMA error where
 * we don't know whether it was a READ or a WRITE, or
 * even a READ or WRITE error that we're not sure whether
 * to call a PIO or DMA.
 *
 * It is also possible to set both PIO and DMA, and possible
 * to set both READ and WRITE; the first may be nonsensical
 * but the second *could* be used to designate an access
 * that is known to be a read-modify-write cycle. It is
 * quite possible that nobody will ever use PIO|DMA or
 * READ|WRITE ... but being flexible is good.

 * IO error structure.
 *
 * This structure would expand to hold the information retrieved from

 *
 * This structure is defined to hold all system specific
 * information related to a single error.
 *
 * This serves a couple of purpose.
 *      - Error handling often involves translating one form of address to other
 *        form. So, instead of having different data structures at each level,
 *        we have a single structure, and the appropriate fields get filled in
 *        at each layer.
 *      - This provides a way to dump all error related information in any layer
 *        of erorr handling (debugging aid).
 *
 * A second possibility is to allow each layer to define its own error
 * data structure, and fill in the proper fields. This has the advantage
 * of isolating the layers.
 * A big concern is the potential stack usage (and overflow), if each layer
 * defines these structures on stack (assuming we don't want to do kmalloc.
 *
 * Any layer wishing to pass extra information to a layer next to it in
 * error handling hierarchy, can do so as a separate parameter.
