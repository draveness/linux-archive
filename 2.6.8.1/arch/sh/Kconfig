	  will be able to flush the buffer cache to disk, reboot the system
	  immediately or dump some status information). This is accomplished
	  by pressing various keys while holding SysRq (Alt+PrintScreen). It
	  also works on a serial console (on PC hardware at least), if you
	  send a BREAK and then within 5 seconds a command keypress. The
	  keys are documented in <file:Documentation/sysrq.txt>. Don't say Y
	  unless you really know what this hack does.

config DEBUG_SPINLOCK
	bool "Spinlock debugging"
	help
	  Say Y here and build SMP to catch missing spinlock initialization
	  and certain other kinds of spinlock errors commonly made.  This is
	  best used in conjunction with the NMI watchdog so that spinlock
	  deadlocks are also debuggable.

config DEBUG_INFO
        bool "Compile the kernel with debug info"
        help
          If you say Y here the resulting kernel image will include
          debugging info resulting in a larger kernel image.
          Say Y here only if you plan to use gdb to debug the kernel.
          If you don't debug the kernel, you can say N.

config SH_STANDARD_BIOS
	bool "Use LinuxSH standard BIOS"
	help
	  Say Y here if your target has the gdb-sh-stub
	  package from www.m17n.org (or any conforming standard LinuxSH BIOS)
	  in FLASH or EPROM.  The kernel will use standard BIOS calls during
	  boot for various housekeeping tasks (including calls to read and
	  write characters to a system console, get a MAC address from an
	  on-board Ethernet interface, and shut down the hardware).  Note this
	  does not work with machines with an existing operating system in
	  mask ROM and no flash (WindowsCE machines fall in this category).
	  If unsure, say N.

config EARLY_SCIF_CONSOLE
	bool "Use early SCIF console"
	depends on CPU_SH4

config EARLY_PRINTK
	bool "Early printk support"
	depends on SH_STANDARD_BIOS || EARLY_SCIF_CONSOLE
	help
	  Say Y here to redirect kernel printk messages to the serial port
	  used by the SH-IPL bootloader, starting very early in the boot
	  process and ending when the kernel's serial console is initialised.
	  This option is only useful porting the kernel to a new machine,
	  when the kernel may crash or hang before the serial console is
	  initialised. If unsure, say N.

config KGDB
	bool "Include KGDB kernel debugger"
	help
	  Include in-kernel hooks for kgdb, the Linux kernel source level
	  debugger.  See <http://kgdb.sourceforge.net/> for more information.
	  Unless you are intending to debug the kernel, say N here.

	  If you say Y here the resulting kernel image will be slightly larger

	  If you don't debug the kernel, you can say N, but we may not be able
	  to solve problems without frame pointers.
