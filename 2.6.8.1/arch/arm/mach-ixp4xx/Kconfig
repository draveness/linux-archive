config IXP4XX_INDIRECT_PCI
	bool "Use indirect PCI memory access"
	help
          IXP4xx provides two methods of accessing PCI memory space:

          1) A direct mapped window from 0x48000000 to 0x4bffffff (64MB).
             To access PCI via this space, we simply ioremap() the BAR
             into the kernel and we can use the standard read[bwl]/write[bwl]
             macros. This is the preffered method due to speed but it
             limits the system to just 64MB of PCI memory. This can be 
             problamatic if using video cards and other memory-heavy devices.
          
          2) If > 64MB of memory space is required, the IXP4xx can be 
	     configured to use indirect registers to access PCI This allows 
	     for up to 128MB (0x48000000 to 0x4fffffff) of memory on the bus. 
	     The disadvantadge of this is that every PCI access requires 
	     three local register accesses plus a spinlock, but in some 
	     cases the performance hit is acceptable. In addition, you cannot 
	     mmap() PCI devices in this case due to the indirect nature
	     of the PCI window.

	  By default, the direct method is used. Choose this option if you
	  need to use the indirect method instead. If you don't know
	  what you need, leave this option unselected.
