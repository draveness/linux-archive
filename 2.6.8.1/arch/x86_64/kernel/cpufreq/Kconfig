	bool "CPU Frequency scaling"
	help
	  Clock scaling allows you to change the clock speed of CPUs on the
	  fly. This is a nice method to save battery power on notebooks,
	  because the lower the clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.

	  For more information, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>
	  or at <http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/cpufreq/>

	  If in doubt, say N.

config CPU_FREQ_TABLE

       depends on CPU_FREQ
       default y
       help
         Many CPUFreq drivers use these helpers, so only say N here if
	 the CPUFreq driver of your choice doesn't need these helpers.

	 If in doubt, say Y.
