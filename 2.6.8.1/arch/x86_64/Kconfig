	  Write kernel log output directly into the VGA buffer or to a serial

	  This is useful for kernel debugging when your machine crashes very
	  early before the console code is initialized. For normal operation
	  it is not recommended because it looks ugly and doesn't cooperate
	  with klogd/syslogd or the X server. You should normally N here,
	  unless you want to debug such a crash.
	  
config HPET_TIMER
	bool
	default y
	help
	  Use the IA-PC HPET (High Precision Event Timer) to manage
	  time in preference to the PIT and RTC, if a HPET is
	  present.  The HPET provides a stable time base on SMP
	  systems, unlike the RTC, but it is more expensive to access,
	  as it is off-chip.  You can find the HPET spec at
	  <http://www.intel.com/labs/platcomp/hpet/hpetspec.htm>.

	---help---
	  If you say Y here the 'File systems' section, you will be
	  able to update the microcode on Intel processors. You will 
	  obviously need the actual microcode binary data itself which is 
	  not shipped with the Linux kernel.

	  For latest news and information on obtaining all the required
	  ingredients for this driver, check:
	  <http://www.urbanmyth.org/microcode/>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called microcode.
	  If you use modprobe or kmod you may also want to add the line
	  'alias char-major-10-184 microcode' to your /etc/modules.conf file.

config X86_CPUID

	  This device gives processes access to the x86 CPUID instruction to

config MTRR
	bool "MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support"
	---help---
	  On Intel P6 family processors (Pentium Pro, Pentium II and later)
	  the Memory Type Range Registers (MTRRs) may be used to control
	  processor access to memory ranges. This is most useful if you have
	  a video (VGA) card on a PCI or AGP bus. Enabling write-combining
	  allows bus write transfers to be combined into a larger transfer
	  before bursting over the PCI/AGP bus. This can increase performance
	  of image write operations 2.5 times or more. Saying Y here creates a
	  /proc/mtrr file which may be used to manipulate your processor's
	  MTRRs. Typically the X server should use this.

	  This code has a reasonably generic interface so that similar
	  control registers on other processors can be easily supported
	  as well.

	  Saying Y here also fixes a problem with buggy SMP BIOSes which only
	  set the MTRRs for the boot CPU and not for the secondary CPUs. This
	  can lead to all sorts of problems, so it's good to say Y here.

	  Just say Y here, all x86-64 machines support MTRRs.

	  See <file:Documentation/mtrr.txt> for more information.

config SMP
	bool "Symmetric multi-processing support"
	---help---
	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
	  a system with only one CPU, like most personal computers, say N. If
	  you have a system with more than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  singleprocessor machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say N.

config PREEMPT
	bool "Preemptible Kernel"
	---help---
	  This option reduces the latency of the kernel when reacting to
	  real-time or interactive events by allowing a low priority process to
	  be preempted even if it is in kernel mode executing a system call.
	  This allows applications to run more reliably even when the system is
	  under load. On contrary it may also break your drivers and add
	  priority inheritance problems to your system. Don't select it if 
	  you rely on a stable system or have slightly obscure hardware.
	  It's also not very well tested on x86-64 currently.
	  You have been warned.

	  Say Y here if you are feeling brave and building a kernel for a 
	  desktop, embedded or real-time system.  Say N if you are unsure. 

config SCHED_SMT
	bool "SMT (Hyperthreading) scheduler support"
	depends on SMP
	default off
	help
	  SMT scheduler support improves the CPU scheduler's decision making
	  when dealing with Intel Pentium 4 chips with HyperThreading at a
	  cost of slightly increased overhead in some places. If unsure say
	  N here.

config K8_NUMA
       bool "K8 NUMA support"
       depends on SMP
       help
	  Enable NUMA (Non Unified Memory Architecture) support for
	  AMD Opteron Multiprocessor systems. The kernel will try to allocate
	  memory used by a CPU on the local memory controller of the CPU
	  and add some more NUMA awareness to the kernel.
	  This code is recommended on all multiprocessor Opteron systems
	  and normally doesn't hurt on others.

config DISCONTIGMEM
       bool

# to use clustered mode or whatever your big iron needs
config NR_CPUS
	int "Maximum number of CPUs (2-8)"
	range 2 8
	depends on SMP
	default "8"
	help
	  This allows you to specify the maximum number of CPUs which this
	  kernel will support.  The maximum supported value is 32 and the
	  minimum value which makes sense is 2.

	  This is purely to save memory - each supported CPU requires
	  memory in the static kernel configuration.

config GART_IOMMU
	bool "IOMMU support"
	help
	  Support the K8 IOMMU. Needed to run systems with more than 4GB of memory
	  properly with 32-bit PCI devices that do not support DAC (Double Address
	  Cycle). The IOMMU can be turned off at runtime with the iommu=off parameter.
	  Normally the kernel will take the right choice by itself.
	  If unsure say Y 

# need this always enabled with GART_IOMMU for the VIA workaround
config SWIOTLB
       bool
       depends on GART_IOMMU
       default y

config DUMMY_IOMMU
	bool
	depends on !GART_IOMMU && !SWIOTLB
	default y
	help
	  Don't use IOMMU code. This will cause problems when you have more than 4GB 
	  of memory and any 32-bit devices. Don't turn on unless you know what you
	  are doing.

	  memory.

config MAGIC_SYSRQ
	bool "Magic SysRq key"
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will have some control over the system even
	  if the system crashes for example during kernel debugging (e.g., you
	  will be able to flush the buffer cache to disk, reboot the system
	  immediately or dump some status information). This is accomplished
	  by pressing various keys while holding SysRq (Alt+PrintScreen). It
	  also works on a serial console (on PC hardware at least), if you
	  send a BREAK and then within 5 seconds a command keypress. The
	  keys are documented in <file:Documentation/sysrq.txt>. Don't say Y
	  unless you really know what this hack does.

config DEBUG_SPINLOCK
	bool "Spinlock debugging"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here and build SMP to catch missing spinlock initialization
	  and certain other kinds of spinlock errors commonly made.  This is
	  best used in conjunction with the NMI watchdog so that spinlock
	  deadlocks are also debuggable.

# !SMP for now because the context switch early causes GPF in segment reloading
# and the GS base checking does the wrong thing then, causing a hang.
config CHECKING

config INIT_DEBUG

config DEBUG_INFO

	  Say Y here only if you plan to use gdb to debug the kernel.
	  Please note that this option requires new binutils.
	  If you don't debug the kernel, you can say N.
	  
config FRAME_POINTER
       bool "Compile the kernel with frame pointers"
       help
	 Compile the kernel with frame pointers. This may help for some 
	 debugging with external debuggers. Note the standard oops backtracer 
	 doesn't make use of this  and the x86-64 kernel doesn't ensure an consistent
	 frame pointer through inline assembly (semaphores etc.)
	 Normally you should say N.

config IOMMU_DEBUG

       bool "Enable IOMMU debugging"

         Force the IOMMU to on even when you have less than 4GB of
	 memory and add debugging code. On overflow always panic. And
	 allow to enable IOMMU leak tracing. Can be disabled at boot
	 time with iommu=noforce. This will also enable scatter gather
	 list merging.  Currently not recommended for production
	 code. When you use it make sure you have a big enough
	 IOMMU/AGP aperture.  Most of the options enabled by this can
	 be set more finegrained using the iommu= command line
	 options. See Documentation/x86_64/boot-options.txt for more
	 details.

config IOMMU_LEAK
       bool "IOMMU leak tracing"
       depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
       depends on IOMMU_DEBUG
       help
         Add a simple leak tracer to the IOMMU code. This is useful when you
	 are debugging a buggy device driver that leaks IOMMU mappings.
