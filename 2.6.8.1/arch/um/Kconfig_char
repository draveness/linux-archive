config STDIO_CONSOLE
	bool
	default y

config SSL
	bool "Virtual serial line"
	help
        The User-Mode Linux environment allows you to create virtual serial
        lines on the UML that are usually made to show up on the host as
        ttys or ptys.

        See <http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/input.html> for more
        information and command line examples of how to use this facility.

        Unless you have a specific reason for disabling this, say Y.

config FD_CHAN
	bool "file descriptor channel support"
	help
        This option enables support for attaching UML consoles and serial
        lines to already set up file descriptors.  Generally, the main
        console is attached to file descriptors 0 and 1 (stdin and stdout),
        so it would be wise to leave this enabled unless you intend to
        attach it to some other host device.

config NULL_CHAN
	bool "null channel support"
	help
        This option enables support for attaching UML consoles and serial
        lines to a device similar to /dev/null.  Data written to it disappears
        and there is never any data to be read.

config PORT_CHAN
	bool "port channel support"
	help
        This option enables support for attaching UML consoles and serial
        lines to host portals.  They may be accessed with 'telnet <host>
        <port number>'.  Any number of consoles and serial lines may be
        attached to a single portal, although what UML device you get when
        you telnet to that portal will be unpredictable.
        It is safe to say 'Y' here.

config PTY_CHAN
	bool "pty channel support"
	help
        This option enables support for attaching UML consoles and serial
        lines to host pseudo-terminals.  Access to both traditional
        pseudo-terminals (/dev/pty*) and pts pseudo-terminals are controlled
        with this option.  The assignment of UML devices to host devices
        will be announced in the kernel message log.
        It is safe to say 'Y' here.

config TTY_CHAN
	bool "tty channel support"
	help
        This option enables support for attaching UML consoles and serial
        lines to host terminals.  Access to both virtual consoles
        (/dev/tty*) and the slave side of pseudo-terminals (/dev/ttyp* and
        /dev/pts/*) are controlled by this option.
        It is safe to say 'Y' here.

config XTERM_CHAN
	bool "xterm channel support"
	help
        This option enables support for attaching UML consoles and serial
        lines to xterms.  Each UML device so assigned will be brought up in
        its own xterm.
        If you disable this option, then CONFIG_PT_PROXY will be disabled as
        well, since UML's gdb currently requires an xterm.
        It is safe to say 'Y' here.

config CON_ZERO_CHAN
	string "Default main console channel initialization"
	default "fd:0,fd:1"
	help
        This is the string describing the channel to which the main console
        will be attached by default.  This value can be overridden from the
        command line.  The default value is "fd:0,fd:1", which attaches the
        main console to stdin and stdout.
        It is safe to leave this unchanged.

config CON_CHAN
	string "Default console channel initialization"
	default "xterm"
	help
        This is the string describing the channel to which all consoles
        except the main console will be attached by default.  This value can
        be overridden from the command line.  The default value is "xterm",
        which brings them up in xterms.
        It is safe to leave this unchanged, although you may wish to change
        this if you expect the UML that you build to be run in environments
        which don't have X or xterm available.

config SSL_CHAN
	string "Default serial line channel initialization"
	default "pty"
	help
        This is the string describing the channel to which the serial lines
        will be attached by default.  This value can be overridden from the
        command line.  The default value is "pty", which attaches them to
        traditional pseudo-terminals.
        It is safe to leave this unchanged, although you may wish to change
        this if you expect the UML that you build to be run in environments
        which don't have a set of /dev/pty* devices.

config UNIX98_PTYS
	bool "Unix98 PTY support"

config UNIX98_PTY_COUNT
	int "Maximum number of Unix98 PTYs in use (0-2048)"
	depends on UNIX98_PTYS
	default "256"

config WATCHDOG
	bool "Watchdog Timer Support"

config WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT
	bool "Disable watchdog shutdown on close"
	depends on WATCHDOG

config SOFT_WATCHDOG
	tristate "Software Watchdog"
	depends on WATCHDOG

config UML_WATCHDOG
	tristate "UML watchdog"
	depends on WATCHDOG

config UML_SOUND
	tristate "Sound support"
	help
        This option enables UML sound support.  If enabled, it will pull in
        soundcore and the UML hostaudio relay, which acts as a intermediary
        between the host's dsp and mixer devices and the UML sound system.
        It is safe to say 'Y' here.

config SOUND
	tristate
	default UML_SOUND
