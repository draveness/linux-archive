/*
     The 'zlib' compression library provides in-memory compression and
  decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed
  data.  This version of the library supports only one compression method
  (deflation) but other algorithms may be added later and will have the same
  stream interface.

     For compression the application must provide the output buffer and
  may optionally provide the input buffer for optimization. For decompression,
  the application must provide the input buffer and may optionally provide
  the output buffer for optimization.

     Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large
  enough (for example if an input file is mmap'ed), or can be done by
  repeated calls of the compression function.  In the latter case, the
  application must provide more input and/or consume the output
  (providing more output space) before each call.

   The application must update next_in and avail_in when avail_in has

   has dropped to zero. The application must initialize zalloc, zfree and
   opaque before calling the init function. All other fields are set by the
   compression library and must not be updated by the application.

   The opaque value provided by the application will be passed as the first
   parameter for calls of zalloc and zfree. This can be useful for custom
   memory management. The compression library attaches no meaning to the
   opaque value.

   zalloc must return Z_NULL if there is not enough memory for the object.
   On 16-bit systems, the functions zalloc and zfree must be able to allocate
   exactly 65536 bytes, but will not be required to allocate more than this
   if the symbol MAXSEG_64K is defined (see zconf.h). WARNING: On MSDOS,
   pointers returned by zalloc for objects of exactly 65536 bytes *must*
   have their offset normalized to zero. The default allocation function
   provided by this library ensures this (see zutil.c). To reduce memory
   requirements and avoid any allocation of 64K objects, at the expense of
   compression ratio, compile the library with -DMAX_WBITS=14 (see zconf.h).

   The fields total_in and total_out can be used for statistics or
   progress reports. After compression, total_in holds the total size of
   the uncompressed data and may be saved for use in the decompressor
   (particularly if the decompressor wants to decompress everything in
   a single step).

*/


extern int inflate OF((z_stream *strm, int flush));
/*
  Performs one or both of the following actions:

  - Decompress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly. If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), next_in is updated and processing
    will resume at this point for the next call of inflate().

  - Provide more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly.  inflate() always provides as much output as possible
    (until there is no more input data or no more space in the output buffer).

  Before the call of inflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming
  more output, and updating the next_* and avail_* values accordingly.
  The application can consume the uncompressed output when it wants, for
  example when the output buffer is full (avail_out == 0), or after each
  call of inflate().

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH or Z_PACKET_FLUSH,
  inflate flushes as much output as possible to the output buffer. The
  flushing behavior of inflate is not specified for values of the flush
  parameter other than Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH, Z_PACKET_FLUSH or Z_FINISH, but the
  current implementation actually flushes as much output as possible
  anyway.  For Z_PACKET_FLUSH, inflate checks that once all the input data
  has been consumed, it is expecting to see the length field of a stored
  block; if not, it returns Z_DATA_ERROR.

    inflate() should normally be called until it returns Z_STREAM_END or an
  error. However if all decompression is to be performed in a single step
  (a single call of inflate), the parameter flush should be set to
  Z_FINISH. In this case all pending input is processed and all pending
  output is flushed; avail_out must be large enough to hold all the
  uncompressed data. (The size of the uncompressed data may have been saved
  by the compressor for this purpose.) The next operation on this stream must
  be inflateEnd to deallocate the decompression state. The use of Z_FINISH
  is never required, but can be used to inform inflate that a faster routine
  may be used for the single inflate() call.

    inflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input
  processed or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if the end of the
  compressed data has been reached and all uncompressed output has been
  produced, Z_DATA_ERROR if the input data was corrupted, Z_STREAM_ERROR if
  the stream structure was inconsistent (for example if next_in or next_out
  was NULL), Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough memory, Z_BUF_ERROR if no
  progress is possible or if there was not enough room in the output buffer
  when Z_FINISH is used. In the Z_DATA_ERROR case, the application may then
  call inflateSync to look for a good compression block.  */

   pending output.

     inflateEnd returns Z_OK if success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream state
   was inconsistent. In the error case, msg may be set but then points to a
   static string (which must not be deallocated).

/*
     This is another version of inflateInit with more compression options. The
   fields next_out, zalloc and zfree must be initialized before by the caller.

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the maximum window
   size (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8..15 for
   this version of the library (the value 16 will be allowed soon). The
   default value is 15 if inflateInit is used instead. If a compressed stream
   with a larger window size is given as input, inflate() will return with
   the error code Z_DATA_ERROR instead of trying to allocate a larger window.

     If next_out is not null, the library will use this buffer for the history
   buffer; the buffer must either be large enough to hold the entire output
   data, or have at least 1<<windowBits bytes.  If next_out is null, the
   library will allocate its own buffer (and leave next_out null). next_in
   need not be provided here but must be provided by the application for the
   next call of inflate().

     If the history buffer is provided by the application, next_out must
   never be changed by the application since the decompressor maintains
   history information inside this buffer from call to call; the application
   can only reset next_out to the beginning of the history buffer when
   avail_out is zero and all output has been consumed.

      inflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was
   not enough memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if a parameter is invalid (such as
   windowBits < 8). msg is set to null if there is no error message.
   inflateInit2 does not perform any decompression: this will be done by
   inflate().

  if no more input was provided, Z_DATA_ERROR if no marker has been found,
  or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream structure was inconsistent. In the success
  case, the application may save the current current value of total_in which
  indicates where valid compressed data was found. In the error case, the
  application may repeatedly call inflateSync, providing more input each time,
  until success or end of the input data.
