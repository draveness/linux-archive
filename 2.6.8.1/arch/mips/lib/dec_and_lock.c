/*
 * This is an implementation of the notion of "decrement a
 * reference count, and return locked if it decremented to zero".
 *
 * This implementation can be used on any architecture that
 * has a cmpxchg, and where atomic->value is an int holding
 * the value of the atomic (i.e. the high bits aren't used
 * for a lock or anything like that).
 *
 * N.B. ATOMIC_DEC_AND_LOCK gets defined in include/linux/spinlock.h
 * if spinlocks are empty and thus atomic_dec_and_lock is defined
 * to be atomic_dec_and_test - in that case we don't need it
 * defined here as well.
