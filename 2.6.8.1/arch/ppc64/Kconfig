config PPC_SPLPAR
	depends on PPC_PSERIES
	bool "Support for shared-processor logical partitions"
	default n
	help
	  Enabling this option will make the kernel run more efficiently
	  on logically-partitioned pSeries systems which use shared
	  processors, that is, which share physical processors between
	  two or more partitions.

config PMAC_DART
	bool "Enable DART/IOMMU on PowerMac (allow >2G of RAM)"
	depends on PPC_PMAC
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	default n
	help
	  Enabling DART makes it possible to boot a PowerMac G5 with more
	  than 2GB of memory. Note that the code is very new and untested
	  at this time, so it has to be considered experimental. Enabling
	  this might result in data loss.

config PPC_PMAC64
	bool
	depends on PPC_PMAC
	default y

config BOOTX_TEXT
	bool "Support for early boot text console"
	depends PPC_OF
	help
	  Say Y here to see progress messages from the boot firmware in text
	  mode. Requires an Open Firmware compatible video card.

config POWER4_ONLY
	bool "Optimize for POWER4"
	default n
	---help---
	  Cause the compiler to optimize for POWER4 processors. The resulting
	  binary will not work on POWER3 or RS64 processors when compiled with
	  binutils 2.15 or later.

config IOMMU_VMERGE
	bool "Enable IOMMU virtual merging (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	default n
	help
	  Cause IO segments sent to a device for DMA to be merged virtually
	  by the IOMMU when they happen to have been allocated contiguously.
	  This doesn't add pressure to the IOMMU allocator. However, some
	  drivers don't support getting large merged segments coming back
	  from *_map_sg(). Say Y if you know the drivers you are using are
	  properly handling this case.

config SMP
	bool "Symmetric multi-processing support"
	---help---
	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
	  a system with only one CPU, say N. If you have a system with more
	  than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on single-processor machines.
	  On a single-processor machine, the kernel will run faster if you say
	  N here.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say Y.

config IRQ_ALL_CPUS
	bool "Distribute interrupts on all CPUs by default"
	depends on SMP && PPC_PSERIES
	help
	  This option gives the kernel permission to distribute IRQs across
	  multiple CPUs.  Saying N here will route all IRQs to the first
	  CPU.

config NR_CPUS
	int "Maximum number of CPUs (2-128)"
	range 2 128
	depends on SMP
	default "32"

config NUMA
	bool "NUMA support"
	depends on DISCONTIGMEM

config SCHED_SMT
	bool "SMT (Hyperthreading) scheduler support"
	depends on SMP
	default off
	help
	  SMT scheduler support improves the CPU scheduler's decision making
	  when dealing with POWER5 cpus at a cost of slightly increased
	  overhead in some places. If unsure say N here.

config PREEMPT
	bool "Preemptible Kernel"
	help
	  This option reduces the latency of the kernel when reacting to
	  real-time or interactive events by allowing a low priority process to
	  be preempted even if it is in kernel mode executing a system call.

	  Say Y here if you are building a kernel for a desktop, embedded
	  or real-time system.  Say N if you are unsure.

config MSCHUNKS
	bool
	depends on PPC_ISERIES
	default y

	Provide system capacity information via human readable 
	<key word>=<value> pairs through a /proc/ppc64/lparcfg interface.

menu "General setup"

config ISA
	bool
	help
	  Find out whether you have ISA slots on your motherboard.  ISA is the
	  name of a bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff
	  inside your box.  If you have an Apple machine, say N here; if you
	  have an IBM RS/6000 or pSeries machine or a PReP machine, say Y.  If
	  you have an embedded board, consult your board documentation.

config SBUS
	bool

config MCA
	bool

config EISA
	bool

config PCI
	bool
	default y
	help
	  Find out whether your system includes a PCI bus. PCI is the name of
	  a bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff inside
	  your box.  If you say Y here, the kernel will include drivers and
	  infrastructure code to support PCI bus devices.

config PROC_DEVICETREE
	bool "Support for Open Firmware device tree in /proc"
	depends on !PPC_ISERIES
	help
	  This option adds a device-tree directory under /proc which contains
	  an image of the device tree that the kernel copies from Open
	  Firmware. If unsure, say Y here.

config CMDLINE_BOOL
	bool "Default bootloader kernel arguments"
	depends on !PPC_ISERIES

config CMDLINE
	string "Initial kernel command string"
	depends on CMDLINE_BOOL
	default "console=ttyS0,9600 console=tty0 root=/dev/sda2"
	help
	  On some platforms, there is currently no way for the boot loader to
	  pass arguments to the kernel. For these platforms, you can supply
	  some command-line options at build time by entering them here.  In
	  most cases you will need to specify the root device here.

 	  virtual disks created and managed by OS/400, say Y.

config VIOCD
	tristate "iSeries Virtual I/O CD support"
	help
	  If you are running Linux on an IBM iSeries system and you want to
	  read a CD drive owned by OS/400, say Y here.

config VIOTAPE
	tristate "iSeries Virtual Tape Support"
	help
	  If you are running Linux on an iSeries system and you want Linux
	  to read and/or write a tape drive owned by OS/400, say Y here.

	help
	  Say Y here if you are developing drivers or trying to debug and
	  identify kernel problems.

config DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW
	bool "Check for stack overflows"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL

config DEBUG_STACK_USAGE
	bool "Stack utilization instrumentation"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Enables the display of the minimum amount of free stack which each
	  task has ever had available in the sysrq-T and sysrq-P debug output.

	  This option will slow down process creation somewhat.

config DEBUG_SLAB
	bool "Debug memory allocations"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here to have the kernel do limited verification on memory
	  allocation as well as poisoning memory on free to catch use of freed
	  memory.

config MAGIC_SYSRQ
	bool "Magic SysRq key"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will have some control over the system even
	  if the system crashes for example during kernel debugging (e.g., you
	  will be able to flush the buffer cache to disk, reboot the system
	  immediately or dump some status information). This is accomplished
	  by pressing various keys while holding SysRq (Alt+PrintScreen). It
	  also works on a serial console (on PC hardware at least), if you
	  send a BREAK and then within 5 seconds a command keypress. The
	  keys are documented in <file:Documentation/sysrq.txt>. Don't say Y
	  unless you really know what this hack does.

config DEBUGGER
	bool "Enable debugger hooks"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Include in-kernel hooks for kernel debuggers. Unless you are
	  intending to debug the kernel, say N here.

config XMON
	bool "Include xmon kernel debugger"
	depends on DEBUGGER
	help
	  Include in-kernel hooks for the xmon kernel monitor/debugger.
	  Unless you are intending to debug the kernel, say N here.

config XMON_DEFAULT
	bool "Enable xmon by default"
	depends on XMON

config PPCDBG
	bool "Include PPCDBG realtime debugging"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL

config DEBUG_INFO
	bool "Compile the kernel with debug info"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
          If you say Y here the resulting kernel image will include
	  debugging info resulting in a larger kernel image.
	  Say Y here only if you plan to use gdb to debug the kernel.
	  If you don't debug the kernel, you can say N.

config IRQSTACKS
	bool "Use separate kernel stacks when processing interrupts"
	help
	  If you say Y here the kernel will use separate kernel stacks
	  for handling hard and soft interrupts.  This can help avoid
	  overflowing the process kernel stacks.
	  
config SPINLINE
	bool "Inline spinlock code at each call site"
	depends on SMP && !PPC_SPLPAR && !PPC_ISERIES
	help
	  Say Y if you want to have the code for acquiring spinlocks
	  and rwlocks inlined at each call site.  This makes the kernel
	  somewhat bigger, but can be useful when profiling the kernel.

	  If in doubt, say N.
