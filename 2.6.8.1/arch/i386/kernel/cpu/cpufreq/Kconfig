config CPU_FREQ
	bool "CPU Frequency scaling"
	help
	  Clock scaling allows you to change the clock speed of CPUs on the
	  fly. This is a nice method to save battery power on notebooks,
	  because the lower the clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.

	  For more information, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>
	  or at <http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/cpufreq/>

	  If in doubt, say N.

config CPU_FREQ_TABLE
       tristate "CPU frequency table helpers"
       depends on CPU_FREQ
       default y
       help
         Many CPUFreq drivers use these helpers, so only say N here if
	 the CPUFreq driver of your choice doesn't need these helpers.

	 If in doubt, say Y.

config X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ
	tristate "ACPI Processor P-States driver"
	depends on CPU_FREQ_TABLE && ACPI_PROCESSOR

	help
	  This enables the deprecated /proc/acpi/processor/../performance 
	  interface. While it is helpful for debugging, the generic,
	  cross-architecture cpufreq interfaces should be used.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config ELAN_CPUFREQ

	depends on CPU_FREQ_TABLE && X86_ELAN
	---help---
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for AMD Elan SC400 and SC410
	  processors.

	  You need to specify the processor maximum speed as boot
	  parameter: elanfreq=maxspeed (in kHz) or as module
	  parameter "max_freq".

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

	  Use primarily the information provided in the BIOS ACPI tables
	  to determine valid CPU frequency and voltage pairings.

	  If in doubt, say Y.

config X86_SPEEDSTEP_ICH
	tristate "Intel Speedstep on ICH-M chipsets (ioport interface)"
	depends on CPU_FREQ_TABLE

	help
	  Don't perform all checks for a speedstep capable system which would 
	  normally be done. Some ancient or strange systems, though speedstep 
	  capable, don't always indicate that they are speedstep capable. This 
	  option let's the probing code bypass some of those checks if the
	  parameter "relaxed_check=1" is passed to the module.
