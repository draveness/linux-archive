config M386
	bool "386"
	---help---
	  This is the processor type of your CPU. This information is used for
	  optimizing purposes. In order to compile a kernel that can run on
	  all x86 CPU types (albeit not optimally fast), you can specify
	  "386" here.

	  The kernel will not necessarily run on earlier architectures than
	  the one you have chosen, e.g. a Pentium optimized kernel will run on
	  a PPro, but not necessarily on a i486.

	  Here are the settings recommended for greatest speed:
	  - "386" for the AMD/Cyrix/Intel 386DX/DXL/SL/SLC/SX, Cyrix/TI
	  486DLC/DLC2, UMC 486SX-S and NexGen Nx586.  Only "386" kernels
	  will run on a 386 class machine.
	  - "486" for the AMD/Cyrix/IBM/Intel 486DX/DX2/DX4 or
	  SL/SLC/SLC2/SLC3/SX/SX2 and UMC U5D or U5S.
	  - "586" for generic Pentium CPUs lacking the TSC
	  (time stamp counter) register.
	  - "Pentium-Classic" for the Intel Pentium.
	  - "Pentium-MMX" for the Intel Pentium MMX.
	  - "Pentium-Pro" for the Intel Pentium Pro.
	  - "Pentium-II" for the Intel Pentium II or pre-Coppermine Celeron.
	  - "Pentium-III" for the Intel Pentium III or Coppermine Celeron.
	  - "Pentium-4" for the Intel Pentium 4 or P4-based Celeron.
	  - "K6" for the AMD K6, K6-II and K6-III (aka K6-3D).
	  - "Athlon" for the AMD K7 family (Athlon/Duron/Thunderbird).
	  - "Crusoe" for the Transmeta Crusoe series.
	  - "Winchip-C6" for original IDT Winchip.
	  - "Winchip-2" for IDT Winchip 2.
	  - "Winchip-2A" for IDT Winchips with 3dNow! capabilities.
	  - "CyrixIII/VIA C3" for VIA Cyrix III or VIA C3.
	  - "VIA C3-2 for VIA C3-2 "Nehemiah" (model 9 and above).

	  If you don't know what to do, choose "386".

config M486
	bool "486"
	help
	  Select this for a 486 series processor, either Intel or one of the
	  compatible processors from AMD, Cyrix, IBM, or Intel.  Includes DX,
	  DX2, and DX4 variants; also SL/SLC/SLC2/SLC3/SX/SX2 and UMC U5D or
	  U5S.

config M586
	bool "586/K5/5x86/6x86/6x86MX"
	help
	  Select this for an 586 or 686 series processor such as the AMD K5,
	  the Intel 5x86 or 6x86, or the Intel 6x86MX.  This choice does not
	  assume the RDTSC (Read Time Stamp Counter) instruction.

config M586TSC

	help
	  Select this for a Pentium Classic processor with the RDTSC (Read
	  Time Stamp Counter) instruction for benchmarking.

config M586MMX
	bool "Pentium-MMX"
	help
	  Select this for a Pentium with the MMX graphics/multimedia
	  extended instructions.

config M686
	bool "Pentium-Pro"
	help
	  Select this for Intel Pentium Pro chips.  This enables the use of
	  Pentium Pro extended instructions, and disables the init-time guard
	  against the f00f bug found in earlier Pentiums.

config MPENTIUMII
	bool "Pentium-II/Celeron(pre-Coppermine)"
	help
	  Select this for Intel chips based on the Pentium-II and
	  pre-Coppermine Celeron core.  This option enables an unaligned
	  copy optimization, compiles the kernel with optimization flags
	  tailored for the chip, and applies any applicable Pentium Pro
	  optimizations.

config MPENTIUMIII
	bool "Pentium-III/Celeron(Coppermine)/Pentium-III Xeon"
	help
	  Select this for Intel chips based on the Pentium-III and
	  Celeron-Coppermine core.  This option enables use of some
	  extended prefetch instructions in addition to the Pentium II
	  extensions.

config MPENTIUMM
	bool "Pentium M"
	help
	  Select this for Intel Pentium M (not Pentium-4 M)
	  notebook chips.

config MPENTIUM4
	bool "Pentium-4/Celeron(P4-based)/Pentium-4 M/Xeon"
	help
	  Select this for Intel Pentium 4 chips.  This includes the
	  Pentium 4, P4-based Celeron and Xeon, and Pentium-4 M
	  (not Pentium M) chips.  This option enables compile flags
	  optimized for the chip, uses the correct cache shift, and
	  applies any applicable Pentium III optimizations.

config MK6
	bool "K6/K6-II/K6-III"
	help
	  Select this for an AMD K6-family processor.  Enables use of
	  some extended instructions, and passes appropriate optimization
	  flags to GCC.

config MK7
	bool "Athlon/Duron/K7"
	help
	  Select this for an AMD Athlon K7-family processor.  Enables use of
	  some extended instructions, and passes appropriate optimization
	  flags to GCC.

config MK8
	bool "Opteron/Athlon64/Hammer/K8"
	help
	  Select this for an AMD Opteron or Athlon64 Hammer-family processor.  Enables
	  use of some extended instructions, and passes appropriate optimization
	  flags to GCC.

config MCRUSOE
	bool "Crusoe"
	help
	  Select this for a Transmeta Crusoe processor.  Treats the processor
	  like a 586 with TSC, and sets some GCC optimization flags (like a
	  Pentium Pro with no alignment requirements).

config MWINCHIPC6
	bool "Winchip-C6"
	help
	  Select this for an IDT Winchip C6 chip.  Linux and GCC
	  treat this chip as a 586TSC with some extended instructions
	  and alignment requirements.

config MWINCHIP2
	bool "Winchip-2"
	help
	  Select this for an IDT Winchip-2.  Linux and GCC
	  treat this chip as a 586TSC with some extended instructions
	  and alignment requirements.

config MWINCHIP3D
	bool "Winchip-2A/Winchip-3"
	help
	  Select this for an IDT Winchip-2A or 3.  Linux and GCC
	  treat this chip as a 586TSC with some extended instructions
	  and alignment reqirements.  Also enable out of order memory
	  stores for this CPU, which can increase performance of some
	  operations.

config MCYRIXIII
	bool "CyrixIII/VIA-C3"
	help
	  Select this for a Cyrix III or C3 chip.  Presently Linux and GCC
	  treat this chip as a generic 586. Whilst the CPU is 686 class,
	  it lacks the cmov extension which gcc assumes is present when
	  generating 686 code.
	  Note that Nehemiah (Model 9) and above will not boot with this
	  kernel due to them lacking the 3DNow! instructions used in earlier
	  incarnations of the CPU.

config MVIAC3_2
	bool "VIA C3-2 (Nehemiah)"
	help
	  Select this for a VIA C3 "Nehemiah". Selecting this enables usage
	  of SSE and tells gcc to treat the CPU as a 686.
	  Note, this kernel will not boot on older (pre model 9) C3s.

endchoice

config X86_GENERIC
       bool "Generic x86 support" 
       help
	  Instead of just including optimizations for the selected
	  x86 variant (e.g. PII, Crusoe or Athlon), include some more
	  generic optimizations as well. This will make the kernel
	  perform better on x86 CPUs other than that selected.

	  This is really intended for distributors who need more
	  generic optimizations.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  singleprocessor machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  Note that if you say Y here and choose architecture "586" or
	  "Pentium" under "Processor family", the kernel will not work on 486
	  architectures. Similarly, multiprocessor kernels for the "PPro"
	  architecture may not work on all Pentium based boards.

	  The action the kernel takes depends on the severity of the problem,
	  ranging from a warning message on the console, to halting the machine.
	  Your processor must be a Pentium or newer to support this - check the
	  flags in /proc/cpuinfo for mce.  Note that some older Pentium systems
	  have a design flaw which leads to false MCE events - hence MCE is
	  disabled on all P5 processors, unless explicitly enabled with "mce"
	  as a boot argument.  Similarly, if MCE is built in and creates a
	  problem on some new non-standard machine, you can boot with "nomce"

	  Linux can use up to 64 Gigabytes of physical memory on x86 systems.

	  by the kernel to permanently map as much physical memory as
	  possible.

	  If the machine has between 1 and 4 Gigabytes physical RAM, then

	  If more than 4 Gigabytes is used then answer "64GB" here. This

	  such as "mem=256M". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of

config MATH_EMULATION
	bool "Math emulation"
	---help---
	  Linux can emulate a math coprocessor (used for floating point
	  operations) if you don't have one. 486DX and Pentium processors have
	  a math coprocessor built in, 486SX and 386 do not, unless you added
	  a 487DX or 387, respectively. (The messages during boot time can
	  give you some hints here ["man dmesg"].) Everyone needs either a
	  coprocessor or this emulation.

	  If you don't have a math coprocessor, you need to say Y here; if you
	  say Y here even though you have a coprocessor, the coprocessor will
	  be used nevertheless. (This behavior can be changed with the kernel
	  command line option "no387", which comes handy if your coprocessor
	  is broken. Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot
	  loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel at
	  boot time.) This means that it is a good idea to say Y here if you
	  intend to use this kernel on different machines.

	  More information about the internals of the Linux math coprocessor
	  emulation can be found in <file:arch/i386/math-emu/README>.

	  If you are not sure, say Y; apart from resulting in a 66 KB bigger
	  kernel, it won't hurt.

config MTRR
	bool "MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) support"
	---help---
	  On Intel P6 family processors (Pentium Pro, Pentium II and later)
	  the Memory Type Range Registers (MTRRs) may be used to control
	  processor access to memory ranges. This is most useful if you have
	  a video (VGA) card on a PCI or AGP bus. Enabling write-combining
	  allows bus write transfers to be combined into a larger transfer
	  before bursting over the PCI/AGP bus. This can increase performance
	  of image write operations 2.5 times or more. Saying Y here creates a
	  /proc/mtrr file which may be used to manipulate your processor's
	  MTRRs. Typically the X server should use this.

	  This code has a reasonably generic interface so that similar
	  control registers on other processors can be easily supported
	  as well:

	  The Cyrix 6x86, 6x86MX and M II processors have Address Range
	  Registers (ARRs) which provide a similar functionality to MTRRs. For
	  these, the ARRs are used to emulate the MTRRs.
	  The AMD K6-2 (stepping 8 and above) and K6-3 processors have two
	  MTRRs. The Centaur C6 (WinChip) has 8 MCRs, allowing
	  write-combining. All of these processors are supported by this code
	  and it makes sense to say Y here if you have one of them.

	  Saying Y here also fixes a problem with buggy SMP BIOSes which only
	  set the MTRRs for the boot CPU and not for the secondary CPUs. This
	  can lead to all sorts of problems, so it's good to say Y here.

	  You can safely say Y even if your machine doesn't have MTRRs, you'll
	  just add about 9 KB to your kernel.

	  See <file:Documentation/mtrr.txt> for more information.

	---help---
	  APM is a BIOS specification for saving power using several different
	  techniques. This is mostly useful for battery powered laptops with
	  APM compliant BIOSes. If you say Y here, the system time will be
	  reset after a RESUME operation, the /proc/apm device will provide
	  battery status information, and user-space programs will receive
	  notification of APM "events" (e.g. battery status change).

	  If you select "Y" here, you can disable actual use of the APM
	  BIOS by passing the "apm=off" option to the kernel at boot time.

	  Note that the APM support is almost completely disabled for
	  machines with more than one CPU.

	  In order to use APM, you will need supporting software. For location
	  and more information, read <file:Documentation/pm.txt> and the
	  Battery Powered Linux mini-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  This driver does not spin down disk drives (see the hdparm(8)
	  manpage ("man 8 hdparm") for that), and it doesn't turn off
	  VESA-compliant "green" monitors.

	  This driver does not support the TI 4000M TravelMate and the ACER
	  486/DX4/75 because they don't have compliant BIOSes. Many "green"
	  desktop machines also don't have compliant BIOSes, and this driver
	  may cause those machines to panic during the boot phase.

	  Generally, if you don't have a battery in your machine, there isn't
	  much point in using this driver and you should say N. If you get
	  random kernel OOPSes or reboots that don't seem to be related to
	  anything, try disabling/enabling this option (or disabling/enabling
	  APM in your BIOS).

	  Some other things you should try when experiencing seemingly random,
	  "weird" problems:

	  1) make sure that you have enough swap space and that it is
	  enabled.
	  2) pass the "no-hlt" option to the kernel
	  3) switch on floating point emulation in the kernel and pass
	  the "no387" option to the kernel
	  4) pass the "floppy=nodma" option to the kernel
	  5) pass the "mem=4M" option to the kernel (thereby disabling
	  all but the first 4 MB of RAM)
	  6) make sure that the CPU is not over clocked.
	  7) read the sig11 FAQ at <http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/>
	  8) disable the cache from your BIOS settings
	  9) install a fan for the video card or exchange video RAM
	  10) install a better fan for the CPU
	  11) exchange RAM chips
	  12) exchange the motherboard.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called apm.

config APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND

config APM_DO_ENABLE
	bool "Enable PM at boot time"
	depends on APM
	---help---
	  Enable APM features at boot time. From page 36 of the APM BIOS
	  specification: "When disabled, the APM BIOS does not automatically
	  power manage devices, enter the Standby State, enter the Suspend
	  State, or take power saving steps in response to CPU Idle calls."
	  This driver will make CPU Idle calls when Linux is idle (unless this
	  feature is turned off -- see "Do CPU IDLE calls", below). This
	  should always save battery power, but more complicated APM features
	  will be dependent on your BIOS implementation. You may need to turn
	  this option off if your computer hangs at boot time when using APM
	  support, or if it beeps continuously instead of suspending. Turn
	  this off if you have a NEC UltraLite Versa 33/C or a Toshiba
	  T400CDT. This is off by default since most machines do fine without
	  this feature.

config APM_CPU_IDLE
	bool "Make CPU Idle calls when idle"

	help
	  Enable calls to APM CPU Idle/CPU Busy inside the kernel's idle loop.
	  On some machines, this can activate improved power savings, such as
	  a slowed CPU clock rate, when the machine is idle. These idle calls
	  are made after the idle loop has run for some length of time (e.g.,
	  333 mS). On some machines, this will cause a hang at boot time or
	  whenever the CPU becomes idle. (On machines with more than one CPU,

	  virtual console blanks the screen. Note that this is only used by
	  the virtual console screen blanker, and won't turn off the backlight
	  when using the X Window system. This also doesn't have anything to
	  do with your VESA-compliant power-saving monitor. Further, this
	  option doesn't work for all laptops -- it might not turn off your
