/*
 * CHANGELOG :
 * Jun 17, 1994 : Modified to accommodate the broken pre-PCI BIOS SPECIFICATION
 *	Revision 2.0 present on <thys@dennis.ee.up.ac.za>'s ASUS mainboard.
 *
 * Jan 5,  1995 : Modified to probe PCI hardware at boot time by Frederic
 *     Potter, potter@cao-vlsi.ibp.fr
 *
 * Jan 10, 1995 : Modified to store the information about configured pci
 *      devices into a list, which can be accessed via /proc/pci by
 *      Curtis Varner, cvarner@cs.ucr.edu
 *
 * Jan 12, 1995 : CPU-PCI bridge optimization support by Frederic Potter.
 *	Alpha version. Intel & UMC chipset support only.
 *
 * Apr 16, 1995 : Source merge with the DEC Alpha PCI support. Most of the code
 *	moved to drivers/pci/pci.c.
 *
 * Dec 7, 1996  : Added support for direct configuration access of boards
 *      with Intel compatible access schemes (tsbogend@alpha.franken.de)
 *
 * Feb 3, 1997  : Set internal functions to static, save/restore flags
 *	avoid dead locks reading broken PCI BIOS, werner@suse.de 
 *
 * Apr 26, 1997 : Fixed case when there is BIOS32, but not PCI BIOS
 *	(mj@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz)
 *
 * May 7,  1997 : Added some missing cli()'s. [mj]
 * 
 * Jun 20, 1997 : Corrected problems in "conf1" type accesses.
 *      (paubert@iram.es)
 *
 * Aug 2,  1997 : Split to PCI BIOS handling and direct PCI access parts
 *	and cleaned it up...     Martin Mares <mj@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>
 *
 * Feb 6,  1998 : No longer using BIOS to find devices and device classes. [mj]
 *
 * May 1,  1998 : Support for peer host bridges. [mj]
 *
 * Jun 19, 1998 : Changed to use spinlocks, so that PCI configuration space
 *	can be accessed from interrupts even on SMP systems. [mj]
 *
 * August  1998 : Better support for peer host bridges and more paranoid
 *	checks for direct hardware access. Ugh, this file starts to look as
 *	a large gallery of common hardware bug workarounds (watch the comments)
 *	-- the PCI specs themselves are sane, but most implementors should be
 *	hit hard with \hammer scaled \magstep5. [mj]
 *
 * Jan 23, 1999 : More improvements to peer host bridge logic. i450NX fixup. [mj]
 *
 * Feb 8,  1999 : Added UM8886BF I/O address fixup. [mj]
 *
 * August  1999 : New resource management and configuration access stuff. [mj]
 *
 * Sep 19, 1999 : Use PCI IRQ routing tables for detection of peer host bridges.
 *		  Based on ideas by Chris Frantz and David Hinds. [mj]
 *
 * Sep 28, 1999 : Handle unreported/unassigned IRQs. Thanks to Shuu Yamaguchi
 *		  for a lot of patience during testing. [mj]
 *
 * Oct  8, 1999 : Split to pci-i386.c, pci-pc.c and pci-visws.c. [mj]
