config PCI
	bool "PCI support"
	help
	  Find out whether you have a PCI motherboard. PCI is the name of a
	  bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff inside
	  your box. Other bus systems are ISA, EISA, MicroChannel (MCA) or
	  VESA. If you have PCI, say Y, otherwise N.

	  The PCI-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, contains valuable
	  information about which PCI hardware does work under Linux and which
	  doesn't.

config SH_PCIDMA_NONCOHERENT
	bool "Cache and PCI noncoherent"
	depends on PCI
	default y
	help
	  Enable this option if your platform does not have a CPU cache which
	  remains coherent with PCI DMA. It is safest to say 'Y', although you
	  will see better performance if you can say 'N', because the PCI DMA
	  code will not have to flush the CPU's caches. If you have a PCI host
	  bridge integrated with your SH CPU, refer carefully to the chip specs
	  to see if you can say 'N' here. Otherwise, leave it as 'Y'.

config MAGIC_SYSRQ
	bool "Magic SysRq key"
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will have some control over the system even
	  if the system crashes for example during kernel debugging (e.g., you
	  will be able to flush the buffer cache to disk, reboot the system
	  immediately or dump some status information). This is accomplished
	  by pressing various keys while holding SysRq (Alt+PrintScreen). It
	  also works on a serial console (on PC hardware at least), if you
	  send a BREAK and then within 5 seconds a command keypress. The
	  keys are documented in Documentation/sysrq.txt. Don't say Y unless
	  you really know what this hack does.

config FRAME_POINTER
	bool "Compile the kernel with frame pointers"
	default y if KGDB
	help
	  If you say Y here the resulting kernel image will be slightly larger
	  and slower, but it will give very useful debugging information.
	  If you don't debug the kernel, you can say N, but we may not be able
	  to solve problems without frame pointers.
