 * @filp:	file structure describing the inode
 *
 * Limit file size to the page cache limit on architectures where unsigned long
 * is 32-bits. This is the most we can do for now without overflowing the page
 * cache page index. Doing it this way means we don't run into problems because
 * of existing too large files. It would be better to allow the user to read
 * the beginning of the file but I doubt very much anyone is going to hit this
 * check on a 32-bit architecture, so there is no point in adding the extra
 * complexity required to support this.
 *
 * On 64-bit architectures, the check is hopefully optimized away by the
 * compiler.
 *
 * After the check passes, just call generic_file_open() to do its work.
