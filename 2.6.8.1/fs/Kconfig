config EXT3_FS

	help
	  This is the journaling version of the Second extended file system
	  (often called ext3), the de facto standard Linux file system
	  (method to organize files on a storage device) for hard disks.

	  The journaling code included in this driver means you do not have
	  to run e2fsck (file system checker) on your file systems after a
	  crash.  The journal keeps track of any changes that were being made
	  at the time the system crashed, and can ensure that your file system
	  is consistent without the need for a lengthy check.

	  Other than adding the journal to the file system, the on-disk format
	  of ext3 is identical to ext2.  It is possible to freely switch
	  between using the ext3 driver and the ext2 driver, as long as the
	  file system has been cleanly unmounted, or e2fsck is run on the file
	  system.

	  To add a journal on an existing ext2 file system or change the
	  behavior of ext3 file systems, you can use the tune2fs utility ("man
	  tune2fs").  To modify attributes of files and directories on ext3
	  file systems, use chattr ("man chattr").  You need to be using
	  e2fsprogs version 1.20 or later in order to create ext3 journals
	  (available at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/e2fsprogs/>).

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ext3.  Be aware however that the file system
	  of your root partition (the one containing the directory /) cannot

	  for NFS and quotas, please see <http://www.namesys.com/> for links.

	  It is more easily extended to have features currently found in
	  database and keyword search systems than block allocation based file
	  systems are.  The next version will be so extended, and will support
	  plugins consistent with our motto ``It takes more than a license to

	  variable block sizes, is extent based, and makes extensive use of
	  Btrees (directories, extents, free space) to aid both performance
	  and scalability.

	  Refer to the documentation at <http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/>
	  for complete details.  This implementation is on-disk compatible
	  with the IRIX version of XFS.

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called xfs.  Be aware, however, that if the file
	  system of your root partition is compiled as a module, you'll need
	  to use an initial ramdisk (initrd) to boot.

	  information as filesystem metadata and uses journaling to provide a
	  higher level guarantee of consistency.  The on-disk data format for
	  quota is also compatible with the IRIX version of XFS, allowing a
	  filesystem to be migrated between Linux and IRIX without any need
	  for conversion.

	  If unsure, say N.  More comprehensive documentation can be found in
	  README.quota in the xfsprogs package.  XFS quota can be used either

	  diskettes with FAT-based file systems and transparently access the
	  files on them, i.e. MSDOS files will look and behave just like all

	  This FAT support is not a file system in itself, it only provides
	  the foundation for the other file systems. You will have to say Y or
	  M to at least one of "MSDOS fs support" or "VFAT fs support" in
	  order to make use of it.

	  Another way to read and write MSDOS floppies and hard drive
	  partitions from within Linux (but not transparently) is with the

	  Say Y here if you want to run Linux from within an existing DOS
	  partition of your hard drive. The advantage of this is that you can
	  get away without repartitioning your hard drive (which often implies
	  backing everything up and restoring afterwards) and hence you're
	  able to quickly try out Linux or show it to your friends; the
	  disadvantage is that Linux becomes susceptible to DOS viruses and
	  that UMSDOS is somewhat slower than ext2fs.  Another use of UMSDOS
	  is to write files with long unix filenames to MSDOS floppies; it
	  also allows Unix-style soft-links and owner/permissions of files on
	  MSDOS floppies.  You will need a program called umssync in order to
	  make use of UMSDOS; read
	  <file:Documentation/filesystems/umsdos.txt>.

	  To get utilities for initializing/checking UMSDOS file system, or
	  latest patches and/or information, visit the UMSDOS home page at

	  There are also a number of user-space tools available, called
	  ntfsprogs.  These include ntfsundelete and ntfsresize, that work
	  without NTFS support enabled in the kernel.

	  This is a rewrite from scratch of Linux NTFS support and replaced
	  the old NTFS code starting with Linux 2.5.11.  A backport to

	  from the project web site.

	  For more information see <file:Documentation/filesystems/ntfs.txt>

	  disabled by default.  To enable them, supply the option debug_msgs=1
	  at the kernel command line when booting the kernel or as an option
	  to insmod when loading the ntfs module.  Once the driver is active,
	  you can enable debugging messages by doing (as root):
	  echo 1 > /proc/sys/fs/ntfs-debug
	  Replacing the "1" with "0" would disable debug messages.

	  If you leave debugging messages disabled, this results in little
	  overhead, but enabling debug messages results in very significant
	  slowdown of the system.

	  When reporting bugs, please try to have available a full dump of
	  debugging messages while the misbehaviour was occurring.

config NTFS_RW

	  This enables the partial, but safe, write support in the NTFS driver.

	  The only supported operation is overwriting existing files, without
	  changing the file length.  No file or directory creation, deletion or
	  renaming is possible.  Note only non-resident files can be written to
	  so you may find that some very small files (<500 bytes or so) cannot
	  be written to.

	  While we cannot guarantee that it will not damage any data, we have
	  so far not received a single report where the driver would have
	  damaged someones data so we assume it is perfectly safe to use.

	  Note:  While write support is safe in this version (a rewrite from
	  scratch of the NTFS support), it should be noted that the old NTFS
	  write support, included in Linux 2.5.10 and before (since 1997),
	  is not safe.

	The sysfs filesystem is a virtual filesystem that the kernel uses to

	which driver each is bound to. sysfs can also be used to tune devices
	and other kernel subsystems.

	Some system agents rely on the information in sysfs to operate.
	/sbin/hotplug uses device and object attributes in sysfs to assist in
	delegating policy decisions, like persistantly naming devices.

	sysfs is currently used by the block subsystem to mount the root

	  If you only intend to mount files from some other Unix over the

	  BSD and derivate versions of Unix (such as SunOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD,
	  OpenBSD and NeXTstep) use a file system called UFS. Some System V
	  Unixes can create and mount hard disk partitions and diskettes using
	  this file system as well. Saying Y here will allow you to read from
	  these partitions; if you also want to write to them, say Y to the
	  experimental "UFS file system write support", below. Please read the
	  file <file:Documentation/filesystems/ufs.txt> for more information.

          The recently released UFS2 variant (used in FreeBSD 5.x) is
          READ-ONLY supported.

	  If you only intend to mount files from some other Unix over the

	  (using SLIP, PLIP, PPP or Ethernet) and want to mount files residing
	  on that computer (the NFS server) using the Network File Sharing
	  protocol, say Y. "Mounting files" means that the client can access
	  the files with usual UNIX commands as if they were sitting on the
	  client's hard disk. For this to work, the server must run the
	  programs nfsd and mountd (but does not need to have NFS file system
	  support enabled in its kernel). NFS is explained in the Network
	  Administrator's Guide, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#guide>, on its man page: "man
	  nfs", and in the NFS-HOWTO.

	  A superior but less widely used alternative to NFS is provided by
	  the Coda file system; see "Coda file system support" below.

	  If you say Y here, you should have said Y to TCP/IP networking also.
	  This option would enlarge your kernel by about 27 KB.

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the

	  This option enables applications to perform uncached I/O on files
	  in NFS file systems using the O_DIRECT open() flag.  When O_DIRECT
	  is set for a file, its data is not cached in the system's page
	  cache.  Data is moved to and from user-level application buffers
	  directly.  Unlike local disk-based file systems, NFS O_DIRECT has
	  no alignment restrictions.

	  Unless your program is designed to use O_DIRECT properly, you are
	  much better off allowing the NFS client to manage data caching for
	  you.  Misusing O_DIRECT can cause poor server performance or network
	  storms.  This kernel build option defaults OFF to avoid exposing
	  system administrators unwittingly to a potentially hazardous
	  feature.

	  For more details on NFS O_DIRECT, see fs/nfs/direct.c.

	  If unsure, say N.  This reduces the size of the NFS client, and

	  SMB (Server Message Block) is the protocol Windows for Workgroups

	  This is the client VFS module for the Common Internet File System

	  PC operating systems.  The CIFS protocol is fully supported by 
	  file servers such as Windows 2000 (including Windows 2003, NT 4  
	  and Windows XP) as well by Samba (which provides excellent CIFS
	  server support for Linux and many other operating systems). Currently
	  you must use the smbfs client filesystem to access older SMB servers
	  such as Windows 9x and OS/2.

	  The intent of the cifs module is to provide an advanced
	  network file system client for mounting to CIFS compliant servers, 
	  including support for dfs (hierarchical name space), secure per-user
	  session establishment, safe distributed caching (oplock), optional
	  packet signing, Unicode and other internationalization improvements, 
	  and optional Winbind (nsswitch) integration. You do not need to enable
	  cifs if running only a (Samba) server. It is possible to enable both
	  smbfs and cifs (e.g. if you are using CIFS for accessing Windows 2003
