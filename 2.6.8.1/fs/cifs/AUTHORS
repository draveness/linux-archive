The author wishes to express his appreciation and thanks to:
Andrew Tridgell (Samba team) for his early suggestions about smb/cifs VFS
improvements. Thanks to IBM for allowing me the time and test resources to pursue
this project. Jim McDonough from IBM (and the Samba Team) for his help.
The IBM Linux JFS team for explaining many esoteric Linux filesystem features.
Dave Boutcher of IBM Rochester (author of the OS/400 smb/cifs filesystem client)
for proving years ago that a very good smb/cifs client could be done on a Unix like 
operating system.  Volker Lendecke, Andrew Tridgell, Urban Widmark, John Newbigin 
and others for their work on the Linux smbfs module over the years. Thanks to
the other members of the Storage Network Industry Association CIFS Technical
Workgroup for their work specifying this highly complex protocol and finally
thanks to the Samba team for their technical advice and encouragement.
