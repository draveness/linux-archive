config SOUND_BT878
	tristate "BT878 audio dma"
	depends on SOUND_PRIME!=n && SOUND
	---help---
	  Audio DMA support for bt878 based grabber boards.  As you might have
	  already noticed, bt878 is listed with two functions in /proc/pci.
	  Function 0 does the video stuff (bt848 compatible), function 1 does
	  the same for audio data.  This is a driver for the audio part of
	  the chip.  If you say 'Y' here you get a oss-compatible dsp device
	  where you can record from.  If you want just watch TV you probably
	  don't need this driver as most TV cards handle sound with a short
	  cable from the TV card to your sound card's line-in.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called btaudio.

	  It is now possible to load dsp microcode patches into the EMU10K1
	  chip.  These patches are used to implement real time sound
	  processing effects which include for example: signal routing,

	  Some drivers have their own MSS support and saying Y to this option

	  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add

config SOUND_MPU401

	  Be careful with this question.  The MPU401 interface is supported by
	  all sound cards.  However, some natively supported cards have their
	  own driver for MPU401.  Enabling this MPU401 option with these cards
	  will cause a conflict.  Also, enabling MPU401 on a system that
	  doesn't really have a MPU401 could cause some trouble.  If your card
	  was in the list of supported cards, look at the card specific
	  instructions in the <file:Documentation/sound/oss/README.OSS> file.  It
	  is safe to answer Y if you have a true MPU401 MIDI interface card.

	  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add

config SOUND_MAD16

	  Answer Y if your card has a Mozart (OAK OTI-601) or MAD16 (OPTi
	  82C928 or 82C929 or 82C931) audio interface chip. These chips are
	  quite common so it's possible that many no-name cards have one of
	  them. In addition the MAD16 chip is used in some cards made by known
	  manufacturers such as Turtle Beach (Tropez), Reveal (some models)
	  and Diamond (latest ones). Note however that the Tropez sound cards
	  have their own driver; if you have one of those, say N here and Y or
	  M to "Full support for Turtle Beach WaveFront", below.

	  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
	  "mad16=<io>,<irq>,<dma>,<dma2>,<mpuio>,<mpuirq>" to the
	  kernel command line.

	  See also <file:Documentation/sound/oss/Opti> and

config SOUND_PAS

	  other card made by Media Vision or Logitech since those are not
	  PAS16 compatible. Please read <file:Documentation/sound/oss/PAS16>.
	  It is not necessary to add Sound Blaster support separately; it
	  is included in PAS support.

	  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add

	  control it under Linux. If you answer N for Beethoven ADSP-16, you
	  can't control master volume, bass, treble and synth volume.

	  SM Games). For an unknown card you may answer Y if the card claims
	  to be Sound Blaster-compatible.

	  Please read the file <file:Documentation/sound/oss/Soundblaster>.

	  You should also say Y here for cards based on the Avance Logic
	  ALS-007 and ALS-1X0 chips (read <file:Documentation/sound/oss/ALS>) and
	  for cards based on ESS chips (read
	  <file:Documentation/sound/oss/ESS1868> and

	  Answer Y if your card has a FM chip made by Yamaha (OPL2/OPL3/OPL4).
	  Answering Y is usually a safe and recommended choice, however some
	  cards may have software (TSR) FM emulation. Enabling FM support with
	  these cards may cause trouble (I don't currently know of any such
	  cards, however). Please read the file
	  <file:Documentation/sound/oss/OPL3> if your card has an OPL3 chip.

	  If you compile the driver into the kernel, you have to add
