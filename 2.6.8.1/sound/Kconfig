	help
	  If you have a sound card in your computer, i.e. if it can say more
	  than an occasional beep, say Y.  Be sure to have all the information
	  about your sound card and its configuration down (I/O port,
	  interrupt and DMA channel), because you will be asked for it.

	  You want to read the Sound-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>. General information about
	  the modular sound system is contained in the files
	  <file:Documentation/sound/oss/Introduction>.  The file
	  <file:Documentation/sound/oss/README.OSS> contains some slightly
	  outdated but still useful information as well.  Newer sound
	  driver documentation is found in <file:Documentation/sound/alsa/*>.

	  If you have a PnP sound card and you want to configure it at boot
	  time using the ISA PnP tools (read
	  <http://www.roestock.demon.co.uk/isapnptools/>), then you need to
	  compile the sound card support as a module and load that module
	  after the PnP configuration is finished.  To do this, choose M here
	  and read <file:Documentation/sound/oss/README.modules>; the module
	  will be called soundcore.

	  I'm told that even without a sound card, you can make your computer
	  say more than an occasional beep, by programming the PC speaker.
	  Kernel patches and supporting utilities to do that are in the pcsp
	  package, available at <ftp://ftp.infradead.org/pub/pcsp/>.
