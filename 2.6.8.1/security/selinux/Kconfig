config SECURITY_SELINUX
	bool "NSA SELinux Support"
	depends on SECURITY && NET
	default n
	help
	  This selects NSA Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux).
	  You will also need a policy configuration and a labeled filesystem.
	  You can obtain the policy compiler (checkpolicy), the utility for
	  labeling filesystems (setfiles), and an example policy configuration
	  from <http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/>.
	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_BOOTPARAM
	bool "NSA SELinux boot parameter"
	depends on SECURITY_SELINUX
	default n
	help
	  This option adds a kernel parameter 'selinux', which allows SELinux
	  to be disabled at boot.  If this option is selected, SELinux
	  functionality can be disabled with selinux=0 on the kernel
	  command line.  The purpose of this option is to allow a single
	  kernel image to be distributed with SELinux built in, but not
	  necessarily enabled.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_DISABLE
	bool "NSA SELinux runtime disable"
	depends on SECURITY_SELINUX
	default n
	help
	  This option enables writing to a selinuxfs node 'disable', which
	  allows SELinux to be disabled at runtime prior to the policy load.
	  SELinux will then remain disabled until the next boot.
	  This option is similar to the selinux=0 boot parameter, but is to
	  support runtime disabling of SELinux, e.g. from /sbin/init, for
	  portability across platforms where boot parameters are difficult
	  to employ.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_DEVELOP
	bool "NSA SELinux Development Support"
	depends on SECURITY_SELINUX
	default y
	help
	  This enables the development support option of NSA SELinux,
	  which is useful for experimenting with SELinux and developing
	  policies.  If unsure, say Y.  With this option enabled, the
	  kernel will start in permissive mode (log everything, deny nothing)
	  unless you specify enforcing=1 on the kernel command line.  You
	  can interactively toggle the kernel between enforcing mode and
	  permissive mode (if permitted by the policy) via /selinux/enforce.

config SECURITY_SELINUX_MLS
	bool "NSA SELinux MLS policy (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on SECURITY_SELINUX && EXPERIMENTAL
	default n
	help
	  This enables the NSA SELinux Multi-Level Security (MLS) policy in
	  addition to the default RBAC/TE policy.  This policy is
	  experimental and has not been configured for use.  Unless you
	  specifically want to experiment with MLS, say N.
