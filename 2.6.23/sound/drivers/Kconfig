config SND_DUMMY
	tristate "Dummy (/dev/null) soundcard"
	depends on SND
	select SND_PCM
	help
	  Say Y here to include the dummy driver.  This driver does
	  nothing, but emulates various mixer controls and PCM devices.

	  You don't need this unless you're testing the hardware support
	  of programs using the ALSA API.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called snd-dummy.

config SND_VIRMIDI
	tristate "Virtual MIDI soundcard"
	depends on SND_SEQUENCER
	select SND_TIMER
	select SND_RAWMIDI
	help
	  Say Y here to include the virtual MIDI driver.  This driver
	  allows to connect applications using raw MIDI devices to
	  sequencer clients.

	  If you don't know what MIDI is, say N here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called snd-virmidi.

config SND_MTPAV
	tristate "MOTU MidiTimePiece AV multiport MIDI"
	depends on SND
	select SND_RAWMIDI
	help
	  To use a MOTU MidiTimePiece AV multiport MIDI adapter
	  connected to the parallel port, say Y here and make sure that
	  the standard parallel port driver isn't used for the port.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called snd-mtpav.

config SND_MTS64
	tristate "ESI Miditerminal 4140 driver"
	depends on SND && PARPORT
	select SND_RAWMIDI
	help
	  The ESI Miditerminal 4140 is a 4 In 4 Out MIDI Interface with 
          additional SMPTE Timecode capabilities for the parallel port.

	  Say 'Y' to include support for this device.

	  To compile this driver as a module, chose 'M' here: the module 
          will be called snd-mts64.

config SND_SERIAL_U16550
	tristate "UART16550 serial MIDI driver"
	depends on SND
	select SND_RAWMIDI
	help
	  To include support for MIDI serial port interfaces, say Y here
	  and read <file:Documentation/sound/alsa/serial-u16550.txt>.
	  This driver works with serial UARTs 16550 and better.

	  This driver accesses the serial port hardware directly, so
	  make sure that the standard serial driver isn't used or
	  deactivated with setserial before loading this driver.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called snd-serial-u16550.

config SND_MPU401
	tristate "Generic MPU-401 UART driver"
	depends on SND
	select SND_MPU401_UART
	help
	  Say Y here to include support for MIDI ports compatible with
	  the Roland MPU-401 interface in UART mode.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called snd-mpu401.

config SND_PORTMAN2X4
	tristate "Portman 2x4 driver"
	depends on SND && PARPORT
	select SND_RAWMIDI
	help
	  Say Y here to include support for Midiman Portman 2x4 parallel
	  port MIDI device.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called snd-portman2x4.
