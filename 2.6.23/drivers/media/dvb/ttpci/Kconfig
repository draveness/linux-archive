	  This driver only supports the fullfeatured cards with

	  This driver needs an external firmware. Please use the script
	  "<kerneldir>/Documentation/dvb/get_dvb_firmware av7110" to
	  download/extract it, and then copy it to /usr/lib/hotplug/firmware
	  or /lib/firmware (depending on configuration of firmware hotplug).

	  The AV7110 firmware is normally loaded by the firmware hotplug manager.
	  If you want to compile the firmware into the driver you need to say
	  Y here and provide the correct path of the firmware. You need this

	  The AV7110 firmware provides some code to generate an OnScreenDisplay
	  on the video output. This is kind of nonstandard and not guaranteed to
	  be maintained.

	  Anyway, some popular DVB software like VDR uses this OSD to render
