config USB_EHCI_HCD
	tristate "EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support"
	depends on USB && USB_ARCH_HAS_EHCI
	---help---
	  The Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI) is standard for USB 2.0
	  "high speed" (480 Mbit/sec, 60 Mbyte/sec) host controller hardware.
	  If your USB host controller supports USB 2.0, you will likely want to
	  configure this Host Controller Driver.  At the time of this writing, 
	  the primary implementation of EHCI is a chip from NEC, widely available
	  in add-on PCI cards, but implementations are in the works from other 
	  vendors including Intel and Philips.  Motherboard support is appearing.

	  EHCI controllers are packaged with "companion" host controllers (OHCI
	  or UHCI) to handle USB 1.1 devices connected to root hub ports.  Ports
	  will connect to EHCI if the device is high speed, otherwise they
	  connect to a companion controller.  If you configure EHCI, you should
	  probably configure the OHCI (for NEC and some other vendors) USB Host
	  Controller Driver or UHCI (for Via motherboards) Host Controller
	  Driver too.

	  You may want to read <file:Documentation/usb/ehci.txt>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ehci-hcd.

config USB_EHCI_SPLIT_ISO
	bool "Full speed ISO transactions (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB_EHCI_HCD && EXPERIMENTAL
	default n
	---help---
	  This code is new and hasn't been used with many different
	  EHCI or USB 2.0 transaction translator implementations.
	  It should work for ISO-OUT transfers, like audio.

config USB_EHCI_ROOT_HUB_TT
	bool "Root Hub Transaction Translators (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB_EHCI_HCD && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  Some EHCI chips have vendor-specific extensions to integrate
	  transaction translators, so that no OHCI or UHCI companion
	  controller is needed.  It's safe to say "y" even if your
	  controller doesn't support this feature.

	  This supports the EHCI implementation that's originally
	  from ARC, and has since changed hands a few times.

config USB_EHCI_TT_NEWSCHED
	bool "Improved Transaction Translator scheduling (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB_EHCI_HCD && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  This changes the periodic scheduling code to fill more of the low
	  and full speed bandwidth available from the Transaction Translator
	  (TT) in USB 2.0 hubs.  Without this, only one transfer will be
	  issued in each microframe, significantly reducing the number of
	  periodic low/fullspeed transfers possible.

	  If you have multiple periodic low/fullspeed devices connected to a
	  highspeed USB hub which is connected to a highspeed USB Host
	  Controller, and some of those devices will not work correctly
	  (possibly due to "ENOSPC" or "-28" errors), say Y.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  Variation of ARC USB block used in some Freescale chips.

config USB_ISP116X_HCD
	tristate "ISP116X HCD support"
	depends on USB
	---help---
	  The ISP1160 and ISP1161 chips are USB host controllers. Enable this
	  option if your board has this chip. If unsure, say N.

	  This driver does not support isochronous transfers.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called isp116x-hcd.

config USB_OHCI_HCD

	select ISP1301_OMAP if MACH_OMAP_H2 || MACH_OMAP_H3
	select I2C if ARCH_PNX4008
	---help---
	  The Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI) is a standard for accessing
	  USB 1.1 host controller hardware.  It does more in hardware than Intel's
	  UHCI specification.  If your USB host controller follows the OHCI spec,
	  say Y.  On most non-x86 systems, and on x86 hardware that's not using a
	  USB controller from Intel or VIA, this is appropriate.  If your host
	  controller doesn't use PCI, this is probably appropriate.  For a PCI
	  based system where you're not sure, the "lspci -v" entry will list the
	  right "prog-if" for your USB controller(s):  EHCI, OHCI, or UHCI.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ohci-hcd.

	  Enables support for the USB controller on the MPC52xx or
	  STB03xxx processor chip.  If unsure, say Y.

config USB_OHCI_HCD_PPC_OF
	bool "OHCI support for PPC USB controller on OF platform bus"

config USB_UHCI_HCD
	tristate "UHCI HCD (most Intel and VIA) support"
	depends on USB && PCI
	---help---
	  The Universal Host Controller Interface is a standard by Intel for
	  accessing the USB hardware in the PC (which is also called the USB
	  host controller). If your USB host controller conforms to this
	  standard, you may want to say Y, but see below. All recent boards
	  with Intel PCI chipsets (like intel 430TX, 440FX, 440LX, 440BX,
	  i810, i820) conform to this standard. Also all VIA PCI chipsets
	  (like VIA VP2, VP3, MVP3, Apollo Pro, Apollo Pro II or Apollo Pro
	  133). If unsure, say Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called uhci-hcd.

config USB_U132_HCD
	tristate "Elan U132 Adapter Host Controller"
	depends on USB && USB_FTDI_ELAN
	default M
	help
	  The U132 adapter is a USB to CardBus adapter specifically designed
	  for PC cards that contain an OHCI host controller. Typical PC cards
	  are the Orange Mobile 3G Option GlobeTrotter Fusion card. The U132
	  adapter will *NOT* work with PC cards that do not contain an OHCI
	  controller.

	  For those PC cards that contain multiple OHCI controllers only the
	  first one is used.

	  The driver consists of two modules, the "ftdi-elan" module is a
	  USB client driver that interfaces to the FTDI chip within ELAN's
	  USB-to-PCMCIA adapter, and this "u132-hcd" module is a USB host
	  controller driver that talks to the OHCI controller within the
	  CardBus cards that are inserted in the U132 adapter.

	  This driver has been tested with a CardBus OHCI USB adapter, and
	  worked with a USB PEN Drive inserted into the first USB port of
	  the PCCARD. A rather pointless thing to do, but useful for testing.

	  It is safe to say M here.

config USB_SL811_HCD

	help
	  The SL811HS is a single-port USB controller that supports either
	  host side or peripheral side roles.  Enable this option if your
	  board has this chip, and you want to use it as a host controller. 
	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called sl811-hcd.

config USB_SL811_CS
	tristate "CF/PCMCIA support for SL811HS HCD"
	depends on USB_SL811_HCD && PCMCIA
	help
	  Wraps a PCMCIA driver around the SL811HS HCD, supporting the RATOC
	  REX-CFU1U CF card (often used with PDAs).  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

	help
	  The R8A66597 is a USB 2.0 host and peripheral controller.

	  Enable this option if your board has this chip, and you want
	  to use it as a host controller.  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
