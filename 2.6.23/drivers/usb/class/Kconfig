	---help---
	  This driver supports USB modems and ISDN adapters which support the
	  Communication Device Class Abstract Control Model interface.
	  Please read <file:Documentation/usb/acm.txt> for details.

	  If your modem only reports "Cls=ff(vend.)" in the descriptors in
	  /proc/bus/usb/devices, then your modem will not work with this
	  driver.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called cdc-acm.

	tristate "USB Printer support"

	help
	  Say Y here if you want to connect a USB printer to your computer's
	  USB port.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called usblp.
