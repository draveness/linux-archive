/* There are 4 different double linked lists nodelist entries can reside on.

 * ADISC Extended Link Service (ELS) request.  These lists keep track of the
 * nodes affected by an RSCN, or a Link Up (Typically, all nodes are effected
 * by Link Up) event.  The unmapped_list contains all nodes that have
 * successfully logged into at the Fibre Channel level.  The
 * mapped_list will contain all nodes that are mapped FCP targets.
 *
 * The bind list is a list of undiscovered (potentially non-existent) nodes
 * that we have saved binding information on. This information is used when
 * nodes transition from the unmapped to the mapped list.

 * from the PLOGI or ADISC lists. Once the PLOGI and ADISC lists are populated,
 * we will first process the ADISC list.  32 entries are processed initially and
 * ADISC is initited for each one.  Completions / Events for each node are
 * funnelled thru the state machine.  As each node finishes ADISC processing, it
 * starts ADISC for any nodes waiting for ADISC processing. If no nodes are
 * waiting, and the ADISC list count is identically 0, then we are done. For
 * Link Up discovery, since all nodes on the PLOGI list are UNREG_LOGIN'ed, we
 * can issue a CLEAR_LA and reenable Link Events. Next we will process the PLOGI
 * list.  32 entries are processed initially and PLOGI is initited for each one.
 * Completions / Events for each node are funnelled thru the state machine.  As
 * each node finishes PLOGI processing, it starts PLOGI for any nodes waiting
 * for PLOGI processing. If no nodes are waiting, and the PLOGI list count is
 * identically 0, then we are done. We have now completed discovery / RSCN
 * handling. Upon completion, ALL nodes should be on either the mapped or
 * unmapped lists.
