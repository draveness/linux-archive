	  Say Y here to get to see options for hardware crypto devices and
	  processors. This option alone does not add any kernel code.

	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped and disabled.

	default m
	help
	  Some VIA processors come with an integrated crypto engine
	  (so called VIA PadLock ACE, Advanced Cryptography Engine)
	  that provides instructions for very fast cryptographic
	  operations with supported algorithms.
	  
	  The instructions are used only when the CPU supports them.
	  Otherwise software encryption is used.

config CRYPTO_DEV_PADLOCK_AES
	tristate "PadLock driver for AES algorithm"
	depends on CRYPTO_DEV_PADLOCK
	select CRYPTO_BLKCIPHER
	default m
	help
	  Use VIA PadLock for AES algorithm.

	  Available in VIA C3 and newer CPUs.

	  If unsure say M. The compiled module will be
	  called padlock-aes.ko

config CRYPTO_DEV_PADLOCK_SHA

	help
	  Use VIA PadLock for SHA1/SHA256 algorithms.

	  Available in VIA C7 and newer processors.

	  If unsure say M. The compiled module will be
	  called padlock-sha.ko

	  Say 'Y' here to use the AMD Geode LX processor on-board AES
	  engine for the CryptoAPI AES algorithm.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called geode-aes.

	  Select this option if you want to use a PCI-attached cryptographic
	  adapter like:
	  + PCI Cryptographic Accelerator (PCICA)
	  + PCI Cryptographic Coprocessor (PCICC)
	  + PCI-X Cryptographic Coprocessor (PCIXCC)
	  + Crypto Express2 Coprocessor (CEX2C)
	  + Crypto Express2 Accelerator (CEX2A)

config ZCRYPT_MONOLITHIC
	bool "Monolithic zcrypt module"
	depends on ZCRYPT="m"
	help
	  Select this option if you want to have a single module z90crypt.ko
	  that contains all parts of the crypto device driver (ap bus,
	  request router and all the card drivers).
