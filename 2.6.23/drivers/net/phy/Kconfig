config MARVELL_PHY
	tristate "Drivers for Marvell PHYs"
	---help---
	  Currently has a driver for the 88E1011S
	
config DAVICOM_PHY
	tristate "Drivers for Davicom PHYs"
	---help---
	  Currently supports dm9161e and dm9131

config QSEMI_PHY
	tristate "Drivers for Quality Semiconductor PHYs"
	---help---
	  Currently supports the qs6612

config LXT_PHY
	tristate "Drivers for the Intel LXT PHYs"
	---help---
	  Currently supports the lxt970, lxt971

config CICADA_PHY
	tristate "Drivers for the Cicada PHYs"
	---help---
	  Currently supports the cis8204

config VITESSE_PHY
        tristate "Drivers for the Vitesse PHYs"
        ---help---
          Currently supports the vsc8244

config SMSC_PHY
	tristate "Drivers for SMSC PHYs"
	---help---
	  Currently supports the LAN83C185 PHY

config BROADCOM_PHY
	tristate "Drivers for Broadcom PHYs"
	---help---
	  Currently supports the BCM5411, BCM5421 and BCM5461 PHYs.

config ICPLUS_PHY
	tristate "Drivers for ICPlus PHYs"
	---help---
	  Currently supports the IP175C PHY.

config FIXED_PHY
	tristate "Drivers for PHY emulation on fixed speed/link"
	---help---
	  Adds the driver to PHY layer to cover the boards that do not have any PHY bound,
	  but with the ability to manipulate the speed/link in software. The relevant MII
	  speed/duplex parameters could be effectively handled in a user-specified function.
	  Currently tested with mpc866ads.

	bool "Emulation for 10M Fdx fixed PHY behavior"
	depends on FIXED_PHY

config FIXED_MII_100_FDX
	bool "Emulation for 100M Fdx fixed PHY behavior"
	depends on FIXED_PHY
