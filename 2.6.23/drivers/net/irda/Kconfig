comment "SIR device drivers"

config IRTTY_SIR
	tristate "IrTTY (uses Linux serial driver)"
	depends on IRDA
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrTTY line
	  discipline.  To compile it as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called irtty-sir. IrTTY makes it possible to use Linux's
	  own serial driver for all IrDA ports that are 16550 compatible.
	  Most IrDA chips are 16550 compatible so you should probably say Y
	  to this option.  Using IrTTY will however limit the speed of the
	  connection to 115200 bps (IrDA SIR mode).

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  Say Y or M here if you want to build support for the KingSun/DonShine
	  DS-620 IrDA-USB bridge device driver.

	  This USB bridge does not conform to the IrDA-USB device class
	  specification, and therefore needs its own specific driver. This
	  dongle supports SIR speed only (9600 bps).

	  To compile it as a module, choose M here: the module will be called

comment "Old SIR device drivers"

config IRPORT_SIR
	tristate "IrPORT (IrDA serial driver)"
	depends on IRDA && BROKEN_ON_SMP
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrPORT IrDA device
	  driver.  To compile it as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called irport. IrPORT can be used instead of IrTTY and sometimes
	  this can be better.  One example is if your IrDA port does not
	  have echo-canceling, which will work OK with IrPORT since this
	  driver is working in half-duplex mode only.  You don't need to use
	  irattach with IrPORT, but you just insert it the same way as FIR
	  drivers (insmod irport io=0x3e8 irq=11).  Notice that IrPORT is a
	  SIR device driver which means that speed is limited to 115200 bps.

	  If unsure, say Y.
