	  This driver is a light version of i2c-parport.  It doesn't depend
	  on the parport driver, and uses direct I/O access instead.  This
	  might be preferred on embedded systems where wasting memory for
	  the clean but heavy parport handling is not an option.  The
	  drawback is a reduced portability and the impossibility to
	  daisy-chain other parallel port devices.
	  
	  Don't say Y here if you said Y or M to i2c-parport.  Saying M to
	  both is possible but both modules should not be loaded at the same
