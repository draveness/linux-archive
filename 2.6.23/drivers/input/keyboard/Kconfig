	  If you have an RDI PrecisionBook, say Y here if you want to use its
	  built-in keyboard (as opposed to an external keyboard).

	  The PrecisionBook has five keys that conflict with those used by most
	  AT and PS/2 keyboards. These are as follows:

	    PrecisionBook    Standard AT or PS/2

	    F1               F12
	    Left Ctrl        Left Alt

	    Right Ctrl       Caps Lock
	    Left             102nd key (the key to the right of Left Shift)

	  If you say N here, and use the PrecisionBook keyboard, then each key
	  in the left-hand column will be interpreted as the corresponding key
	  in the right-hand column.

	  If you say Y here, and use an external keyboard, then each key in the
	  right-hand column will be interpreted as the key shown in the
	  left-hand column.

	help
	  The "Human Interface Loop" is a older, 8-channel USB-like

	  was adapted from the one written for m68k/hp300, and implements
	  support for a keyboard attached to the HIL port, but not for
	  any other types of HIL input devices like mice or tablets.
	  However, it has been thoroughly tested and is stable.

	  If you want full HIL support including support for multiple
	  keyboards, mice, and tablets, you have to enable the
	  "HP System Device Controller i8042 Support" in the input/serio
	  submenu.

	  This driver implements support for buttons connected
	  to GPIO pins of various CPUs (and some other chips).

	  Say Y here if your device has buttons connected
	  directly to such GPIO pins.  Your board-specific
