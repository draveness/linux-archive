config MTD_UBI

	select CRC32
	help
	  UBI is a software layer above MTD layer which admits of LVM-like
	  logical volumes on top of MTD devices, hides some complexities of
	  flash chips like wear and bad blocks and provides some other useful
	  capabilities. Please, consult the MTD web site for more details
	  (www.linux-mtd.infradead.org).

config MTD_UBI_WL_THRESHOLD
	int "UBI wear-leveling threshold"
	default 4096
	range 2 65536
	depends on MTD_UBI
	help
	  This parameter defines the maximum difference between the highest
	  erase counter value and the lowest erase counter value of eraseblocks
	  of UBI devices. When this threshold is exceeded, UBI starts performing
	  wear leveling by means of moving data from eraseblock with low erase
	  counter to eraseblocks with high erase counter. Leave the default
	  value if unsure.

config MTD_UBI_BEB_RESERVE
	int "Percentage of reserved eraseblocks for bad eraseblocks handling"
	default 1
	range 0 25
	depends on MTD_UBI
	help
	  If the MTD device admits of bad eraseblocks (e.g. NAND flash), UBI
	  reserves some amount of physical eraseblocks to handle new bad
	  eraseblocks. For example, if a flash physical eraseblock becomes bad,
	  UBI uses these reserved physical eraseblocks to relocate the bad one.
	  This option specifies how many physical eraseblocks will be reserved
	  for bad eraseblock handling (percents of total number of good flash
	  eraseblocks). If the underlying flash does not admit of bad
	  eraseblocks (e.g. NOR flash), this value is ignored and nothing is
	  reserved. Leave the default value if unsure.

config MTD_UBI_GLUEBI
	bool "Emulate MTD devices"
	default n
	depends on MTD_UBI
	help
	   This option enables MTD devices emulation on top of UBI volumes: for
	   each UBI volumes an MTD device is created, and all I/O to this MTD
	   device is redirected to the UBI volume. This is handy to make
	   MTD-oriented software (like JFFS2) work on top of UBI. Do not enable
	   this if no legacy software will be used.
