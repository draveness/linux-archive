menu "Mapping drivers for chip access"
	depends on MTD!=n

config MTD_COMPLEX_MAPPINGS
	bool "Support non-linear mappings of flash chips"
	help
	  This causes the chip drivers to allow for complicated
	  paged mappings of flash chips.

config MTD_PHYSMAP
	tristate "CFI Flash device in physical memory map"
	depends on MTD_CFI || MTD_JEDECPROBE || MTD_ROM
	help
	  This provides a 'mapping' driver which allows the NOR Flash and
	  ROM driver code to communicate with chips which are mapped
	  physically into the CPU's memory. You will need to configure
	  the physical address and size of the flash chips on your
	  particular board as well as the bus width, either statically
	  with config options or at run-time.

config MTD_PHYSMAP_START
	hex "Physical start address of flash mapping"
	depends on MTD_PHYSMAP
	default "0x8000000"
	help
	  This is the physical memory location at which the flash chips
	  are mapped on your particular target board. Refer to the
	  memory map which should hopefully be in the documentation for
	  your board.
	  Ignore this option if you use run-time physmap configuration
	  (i.e., run-time calling physmap_configure()).

config MTD_PHYSMAP_LEN
	hex "Physical length of flash mapping"
	depends on MTD_PHYSMAP
	default "0"
	help
	  This is the total length of the mapping of the flash chips on
	  your particular board. If there is space, or aliases, in the
	  physical memory map between the chips, this could be larger
	  than the total amount of flash present. Refer to the memory
	  map which should hopefully be in the documentation for your
	  board.
	  Ignore this option if you use run-time physmap configuration
	  (i.e., run-time calling physmap_configure()).

config MTD_PHYSMAP_BANKWIDTH
	int "Bank width in octets"
	depends on MTD_PHYSMAP
	default "2"
	help
	  This is the total width of the data bus of the flash devices
	  in octets. For example, if you have a data bus width of 32
	  bits, you would set the bus width octect value to 4. This is
	  used internally by the CFI drivers.
	  Ignore this option if you use run-time physmap configuration
	  (i.e., run-time calling physmap_configure()).
