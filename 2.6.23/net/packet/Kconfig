config PACKET
	tristate "Packet socket"
	---help---
	  The Packet protocol is used by applications which communicate
	  directly with network devices without an intermediate network
	  protocol implemented in the kernel, e.g. tcpdump.  If you want them
	  to work, choose Y.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called af_packet.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config PACKET_MMAP
	bool "Packet socket: mmapped IO"
	depends on PACKET
	help
	  If you say Y here, the Packet protocol driver will use an IO
	  mechanism that results in faster communication.

	  If unsure, say N.
