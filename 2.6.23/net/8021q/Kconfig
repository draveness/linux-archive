	tristate "802.1Q VLAN Support"
	---help---
	  Select this and you will be able to create 802.1Q VLAN interfaces
	  on your ethernet interfaces.  802.1Q VLAN supports almost
	  everything a regular ethernet interface does, including
	  firewalling, bridging, and of course IP traffic.  You will need
	  the 'vconfig' tool from the VLAN project in order to effectively
	  use VLANs.  See the VLAN web page for more information:
	  <http://www.candelatech.com/~greear/vlan.html>

	  To compile this code as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called 8021q.

	  If unsure, say N.
