config SMP
	bool "Symmetric multi-processing support (does not work on sun4/sun4c)"
	---help---
	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
	  a system with only one CPU, say N. If you have a system with more
	  than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  singleprocessor machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  People using multiprocessor machines who say Y here should also say
	  Y to "Enhanced Real Time Clock Support", below. The "Advanced Power
	  Management" code will be disabled if you say Y here.

	  See also the <file:Documentation/smp.txt>,
	  <file:Documentation/nmi_watchdog.txt> and the SMP-HOWTO available at
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say N.

config SPARC

# Identify this as a Sparc32 build
config SPARC32
	bool
	default y
	help
	  SPARC is a family of RISC microprocessors designed and marketed by
	  Sun Microsystems, incorporated.  They are very widely found in Sun
	  workstations and clones. This port covers the original 32-bit SPARC;
	  it is old and stable and usually considered one of the "big three"
	  along with the Intel and Alpha ports.  The UltraLinux project
	  maintains both the SPARC32 and SPARC64 ports; its web page is
	  available at <http://www.ultralinux.org/>.

# Global things across all Sun machines.
config ISA
	bool
	help
	  ISA is found on Espresso only and is not supported currently.
	  Say N

config EISA
	bool
	help
	  EISA is not supported.
	  Say N

config MCA
	bool
	help
	  MCA is not supported.
	  Say N

config PCMCIA
	tristate
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to attach PCMCIA- or PC-cards to your Linux
	  computer.  These are credit-card size devices such as network cards,
	  modems or hard drives often used with laptops computers.  There are
	  actually two varieties of these cards: the older 16 bit PCMCIA cards
	  and the newer 32 bit CardBus cards.  If you want to use CardBus
	  cards, you need to say Y here and also to "CardBus support" below.

	  To use your PC-cards, you will need supporting software from David
	  Hinds' pcmcia-cs package (see the file <file:Documentation/Changes>
	  for location).  Please also read the PCMCIA-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as modules, choose M here: the
	  modules will be called pcmcia_core and ds.

config SBUS
	bool
	default y

config SBUSCHAR
	bool
	default y

config SERIAL_CONSOLE
	bool
	default y
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, it will be possible to use a serial port as the
	  system console (the system console is the device which receives all
	  kernel messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user
	  mode). This could be useful if some terminal or printer is connected
	  to that serial port.

	  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible virtual console
	  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
	  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
	  "console=ttyS1". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
	  your boot loader (silo) about how to pass options to the kernel at
	  boot time.)

	  If you don't have a graphics card installed and you say Y here, the
	  kernel will automatically use the first serial line, /dev/ttyS0, as
	  system console.

	  If unsure, say N.

config EMULATED_CMPXCHG
	bool
	default y
	help
	  Sparc32 does not have a CAS instruction like sparc64. cmpxchg()
	  is emulated, and therefore it is not completely atomic.

config SUN_PM
	bool
	default y
	help
	  Enable power management and CPU standby features on supported
	  SPARC platforms.

config SUN4
	bool "Support for SUN4 machines (disables SUN4[CDM] support)"
	depends on !SMP
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here if, and only if, your machine is a sun4. Note that
	  a kernel compiled with this option will run only on sun4.
	  (And the current version will probably work only on sun4/330.)

if !SUN4

config PCI
	bool "Support for PCI and PS/2 keyboard/mouse"
	help
	  CONFIG_PCI is needed for all JavaStation's (including MrCoffee),
	  CP-1200, JavaEngine-1, Corona, Red October, and Serengeti SGSC.
	  All of these platforms are extremely obscure, so say N if unsure.

config SUN_OPENPROMFS
	tristate "Openprom tree appears in /proc/openprom"
	help
	  If you say Y, the OpenPROM device tree will be available as a
	  virtual file system, which you can mount to /proc/openprom by "mount
	  -t openpromfs none /proc/openprom".

	  To compile the /proc/openprom support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called openpromfs.

	  Only choose N if you know in advance that you will not need to modify
	  OpenPROM settings on the running system.

config SPARC_LED
	tristate "Sun4m LED driver"
	help
	  This driver toggles the front-panel LED on sun4m systems
	  in a user-specifiable manner.  Its state can be probed
	  by reading /proc/led and its blinking mode can be changed
	  via writes to /proc/led

source "fs/Kconfig.binfmt"

config SUNOS_EMUL
	bool "SunOS binary emulation"
	help
	  This allows you to run most SunOS binaries.  If you want to do this,
	  say Y here and place appropriate files in /usr/gnemul/sunos. See
	  <http://www.ultralinux.org/faq.html> for more information.  If you
	  want to run SunOS binaries on an Ultra you must also say Y to
	  "Kernel support for 32-bit a.out binaries" above.

menu "Unix98 PTY support"

config UNIX98_PTYS
	bool "Unix98 PTY support"
	---help---
	  A pseudo terminal (PTY) is a software device consisting of two
	  halves: a master and a slave. The slave device behaves identical to
	  a physical terminal; the master device is used by a process to
	  read data from and write data to the slave, thereby emulating a
	  terminal. Typical programs for the master side are telnet servers
	  and xterms.

	  Linux has traditionally used the BSD-like names /dev/ptyxx for
	  masters and /dev/ttyxx for slaves of pseudo terminals. This scheme
	  has a number of problems. The GNU C library glibc 2.1 and later,
	  however, supports the Unix98 naming standard: in order to acquire a
	  pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo
	  terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo
	  terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/<number>. What was
	  traditionally /dev/ttyp2 will then be /dev/pts/2, for example.

	  The entries in /dev/pts/ are created on the fly by a virtual
	  file system; therefore, if you say Y here you should say Y to
	  "/dev/pts file system for Unix98 PTYs" as well.

	  If you want to say Y here, you need to have the C library glibc 2.1
	  or later (equal to libc-6.1, check with "ls -l /lib/libc.so.*").
	  Read the instructions in <file:Documentation/Changes> pertaining to
	  pseudo terminals. It's safe to say N.

config UNIX98_PTY_COUNT
	int "Maximum number of Unix98 PTYs in use (0-2048)"
	depends on UNIX98_PTYS
	default "256"
	help
	  The maximum number of Unix98 PTYs that can be used at any one time.
	  The default is 256, and should be enough for desktop systems. Server
	  machines which support incoming telnet/rlogin/ssh connections and/or
	  serve several X terminals may want to increase this: every incoming
	  connection and every xterm uses up one PTY.

	  When not in use, each additional set of 256 PTYs occupy
	  approximately 8 KB of kernel memory on 32-bit architectures.
