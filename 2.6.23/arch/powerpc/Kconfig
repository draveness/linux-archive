	---help---
	  Some PowerPC chips designed for embedded applications do not have
	  a floating-point unit and therefore do not implement the
	  floating-point instructions in the PowerPC instruction set.  If you
	  say Y here, the kernel will include code to emulate a floating-point
	  unit, which will allow programs that use floating-point
	  instructions to run.

config IOMMU_VMERGE
	bool "Enable IOMMU virtual merging (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && PPC64
	default n
	help
	  Cause IO segments sent to a device for DMA to be merged virtually
	  by the IOMMU when they happen to have been allocated contiguously.
	  This doesn't add pressure to the IOMMU allocator. However, some
	  drivers don't support getting large merged segments coming back
	  from *_map_sg(). Say Y if you know the drivers you are using are
	  properly handling this case.

config HOTPLUG_CPU

config KEXEC
	bool "kexec system call (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on (PPC_PRPMC2800 || PPC_MULTIPLATFORM) && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  kexec is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your
	  current kernel, and to start another kernel.  It is like a reboot
	  but it is independent of the system firmware.   And like a reboot
	  you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.

	  The name comes from the similarity to the exec system call.

	  It is an ongoing process to be certain the hardware in a machine
	  is properly shutdown, so do not be surprised if this code does not
	  initially work for you.  It may help to enable device hotplugging
	  support.  As of this writing the exact hardware interface is
	  strongly in flux, so no good recommendation can be made.

config CRASH_DUMP
	bool "Build a kdump crash kernel (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on PPC_MULTIPLATFORM && PPC64 && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Build a kernel suitable for use as a kdump capture kernel.
	  The kernel will be linked at a different address than normal, and
	  so can only be used for Kdump.

	  Don't change this unless you know what you are doing.

	default y if PPC_PREP

config IRQ_ALL_CPUS
	bool "Distribute interrupts on all CPUs by default"
	depends on SMP && !MV64360
	help
	  This option gives the kernel permission to distribute IRQs across
	  multiple CPUs.  Saying N here will route all IRQs to the first
	  CPU.  Generally saying Y is safe, although some problems have been
	  reported with SMP Power Macintoshes with this option enabled.

	select PPC_HAS_HASH_64K
	help
	  This option changes the kernel logical page size to 64k. On machines
	  without processor support for 64k pages, the kernel will simulate
	  them by loading each individual 4k page on demand transparently,
	  while on hardware with such support, it will be used to map
	  normal application pages.

config SCHED_SMT
	bool "SMT (Hyperthreading) scheduler support"
	depends on PPC64 && SMP
	help
	  SMT scheduler support improves the CPU scheduler's decision making
	  when dealing with POWER5 cpus at a cost of slightly increased
	  overhead in some places. If unsure say N here.

config PROC_DEVICETREE
	bool "Support for device tree in /proc"
	depends on PROC_FS
	help
	  This option adds a device-tree directory under /proc which contains
	  an image of the device tree that the kernel copies from Open
	  Firmware or other boot firmware. If unsure, say Y here.

config CMDLINE_BOOL
	bool "Default bootloader kernel arguments"

config CMDLINE
	string "Initial kernel command string"
	depends on CMDLINE_BOOL
	default "console=ttyS0,9600 console=tty0 root=/dev/sda2"
	help
	  On some platforms, there is currently no way for the boot loader to
	  pass arguments to the kernel. For these platforms, you can supply
	  some command-line options at build time by entering them here.  In
	  most cases you will need to specify the root device here.

config SECCOMP
	bool "Enable seccomp to safely compute untrusted bytecode"
	depends on PROC_FS
	default y
	help
	  This kernel feature is useful for number crunching applications
	  that may need to compute untrusted bytecode during their
	  execution. By using pipes or other transports made available to
	  the process as file descriptors supporting the read/write
	  syscalls, it's possible to isolate those applications in
	  their own address space using seccomp. Once seccomp is
	  enabled via /proc/<pid>/seccomp, it cannot be disabled
	  and the task is only allowed to execute a few safe syscalls
	  defined by each seccomp mode.

	  If unsure, say Y. Only embedded should say N here.

config WANT_DEVICE_TREE
	bool
	default n

config DEVICE_TREE
	string "Static device tree source file"
	depends on WANT_DEVICE_TREE
	help
	  This specifies the device tree source (.dts) file to be
	  compiled and included when building the bootwrapper.  If a
	  relative filename is given, then it will be relative to
	  arch/powerpc/boot/dts.  If you are not using the bootwrapper,
	  or do not need to build a dts into the bootwrapper, this
	  field is ignored.

	  For example, this is required when building a cuImage target
	  for an older U-Boot, which cannot pass a device tree itself.
	  Such a kernel will not work with a newer U-Boot that tries to
	  pass a device tree (unless you tell it not to).  If your U-Boot
	  does not mention a device tree in "help bootm", then use the
	  cuImage target and specify a device tree here.  Otherwise, use
	  the uImage target and leave this field blank.
