config PPC601_SYNC_FIX
	bool "Workarounds for PPC601 bugs"
	depends on 6xx && (PPC_PREP || PPC_PMAC)
	help
	  Some versions of the PPC601 (the first PowerPC chip) have bugs which
	  mean that extra synchronization instructions are required near
	  certain instructions, typically those that make major changes to the
	  CPU state.  These extra instructions reduce performance slightly.
	  If you say N here, these extra instructions will not be included,
	  resulting in a kernel which will run faster but may not run at all
	  on some systems with the PPC601 chip.

	  If in doubt, say Y here.

config TAU
	bool "On-chip CPU temperature sensor support"
	depends on CLASSIC32
	help
	  G3 and G4 processors have an on-chip temperature sensor called the
	  'Thermal Assist Unit (TAU)', which, in theory, can measure the on-die
	  temperature within 2-4 degrees Celsius. This option shows the current
	  on-die temperature in /proc/cpuinfo if the cpu supports it.

	  Unfortunately, on some chip revisions, this sensor is very inaccurate
	  and in many cases, does not work at all, so don't assume the cpu
	  temp is actually what /proc/cpuinfo says it is.

config TAU_INT
	bool "Interrupt driven TAU driver (DANGEROUS)"
	depends on TAU
	---help---
	  The TAU supports an interrupt driven mode which causes an interrupt
	  whenever the temperature goes out of range. This is the fastest way
	  to get notified the temp has exceeded a range. With this option off,
	  a timer is used to re-check the temperature periodically.

	  However, on some cpus it appears that the TAU interrupt hardware
	  is buggy and can cause a situation which would lead unexplained hard
	  lockups.

	  Unless you are extending the TAU driver, or enjoy kernel/hardware
	  debugging, leave this option off.

config TAU_AVERAGE
	bool "Average high and low temp"
	depends on TAU
	---help---
	  The TAU hardware can compare the temperature to an upper and lower
	  bound.  The default behavior is to show both the upper and lower
	  bound in /proc/cpuinfo. If the range is large, the temperature is
	  either changing a lot, or the TAU hardware is broken (likely on some
	  G4's). If the range is small (around 4 degrees), the temperature is
	  relatively stable.  If you say Y here, a single temperature value,
	  halfway between the upper and lower bounds, will be reported in
	  /proc/cpuinfo.

	  If in doubt, say N here.

config QUICC_ENGINE
	bool
	help
	  The QUICC Engine (QE) is a new generation of communications
	  coprocessors on Freescale embedded CPUs (akin to CPM in older chips).
	  Selecting this option means that you wish to build a kernel
	  for a machine with a QE coprocessor.

config CPM2
	bool
	default n
	help
	  The CPM2 (Communications Processor Module) is a coprocessor on
	  embedded CPUs made by Freescale.  Selecting this option means that
	  you wish to build a kernel for a machine with a CPM2 coprocessor
	  on it (826x, 827x, 8560).
