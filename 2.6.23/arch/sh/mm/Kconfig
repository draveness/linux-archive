config MMU
        bool "Support for memory management hardware"
	depends on !CPU_SH2
	default y
	help
	  Some SH processors (such as SH-2/SH-2A) lack an MMU. In order to
	  boot on these systems, this option must not be set.

	  On other systems (such as the SH-3 and 4) where an MMU exists,
	  turning this off will boot the kernel on these machines with the
	  MMU implicitly switched off.

config MEMORY_START
	hex "Physical memory start address"
	default "0x08000000"
	---help---
	  Computers built with Hitachi SuperH processors always
	  map the ROM starting at address zero.  But the processor
	  does not specify the range that RAM takes.

	  The physical memory (RAM) start address will be automatically
	  set to 08000000. Other platforms, such as the Solution Engine
	  boards typically map RAM at 0C000000.

	  Tweak this only when porting to a new machine which does not
	  already have a defconfig. Changing it from the known correct
	  value on any of the known systems will only lead to disaster.

config MEMORY_SIZE
	hex "Physical memory size"
	default "0x00400000"
	help
	  This sets the default memory size assumed by your SH kernel. It can
	  be overridden as normal by the 'mem=' argument on the kernel command
	  line. If unsure, consult your board specifications or just leave it
	  as 0x00400000 which was the default value before this became
	  configurable.

	  If you say Y here, physical addressing will be extended to

	  29-bit physical addressing will be used.

config X2TLB
	bool "Enable extended TLB mode"

	help
	  Selecting this option will enable the extended mode of the SH-X2

	  say Y.

config VSYSCALL
	bool "Support vsyscall page"

	default y
	help
	  This will enable support for the kernel mapping a vDSO page
	  in process space, and subsequently handing down the entry point
	  to the libc through the ELF auxiliary vector.

	  From the kernel side this is used for the signal trampoline.
	  For systems with an MMU that can afford to give up a page,
	  (the default value) say Y.

config NUMA

	depends on MMU && SYS_SUPPORTS_NUMA && EXPERIMENTAL
	default n
	help
	  Some SH systems have many various memories scattered around

	  Selecting this option will configure the caches to be direct-mapped,

	  for debugging on platforms with 2 and 4-way caches (SH7750R/SH7751R,
	  SH4-202, SH4-501, etc.)

	  Turn this option off for platforms that do not have a direct-mapped
	  cache, and you have no need to run the caches in such a configuration.

config SH_WRITETHROUGH

	help
	  Selecting this option will configure the caches in write-through
	  mode, as opposed to the default write-back configuration.

	  Since there's sill some aliasing issues on SH-4, this option will
	  unfortunately still require the majority of flushing functions to
	  be implemented to deal with aliasing.

	  If unsure, say N.
