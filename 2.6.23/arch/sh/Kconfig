	help
	  kexec is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your
	  current kernel, and to start another kernel.  It is like a reboot
	  but it is independent of the system firmware.  And like a reboot
	  you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.

	  The name comes from the similarity to the exec system call.

	  It is an ongoing process to be certain the hardware in a machine
	  is properly shutdown, so do not be surprised if this code does not
	  initially work for you.  It may help to enable device hotplugging
	  support.  As of this writing the exact hardware interface is
	  strongly in flux, so no good recommendation can be made.

config CRASH_DUMP
	bool "kernel crash dumps (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Generate crash dump after being started by kexec.
	  This should be normally only set in special crash dump kernels
	  which are loaded in the main kernel with kexec-tools into
	  a specially reserved region and then later executed after
	  a crash by kdump/kexec. The crash dump kernel must be compiled
	  to a memory address not used by the main kernel using
	  MEMORY_START.

config SMP
	bool "Symmetric multi-processing support"

	  a system with only one CPU, like most personal computers, say N. If
	  you have a system with more than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  singleprocessor machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  People using multiprocessor machines who say Y here should also say
	  Y to "Enhanced Real Time Clock Support", below.

	  See also the <file:Documentation/smp.txt>,
