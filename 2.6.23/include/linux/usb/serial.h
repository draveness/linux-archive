 * @num_bulk_out: the number of bulk out endpoints this device will have.
 * @num_ports: the number of different ports this device will have.
 * @calc_num_ports: pointer to a function to determine how many ports this
 *	device has dynamically.  It will be called after the probe()
 *	callback is called, but before attach()
 * @probe: pointer to the driver's probe function.
 *	This will be called when the device is inserted into the system,
 *	but before the device has been fully initialized by the usb_serial
 *	subsystem.  Use this function to download any firmware to the device,
 *	or any other early initialization that might be needed.
 *	Return 0 to continue on with the initialization sequence.  Anything
 *	else will abort it.
 * @attach: pointer to the driver's attach function.
 *	This will be called when the struct usb_serial structure is fully set
 *	set up.  Do any local initialization of the device, or any private
 *	memory structure allocation at this point in time.
 * @shutdown: pointer to the driver's shutdown function.  This will be
 *	called when the device is removed from the system.
 * @usb_driver: pointer to the struct usb_driver that controls this
 *	device.  This is necessary to allow dynamic ids to be added to
 *	the driver from sysfs.
 *
 * This structure is defines a USB Serial driver.  It provides all of
 * the information that the USB serial core code needs.  If the function
 * pointers are defined, then the USB serial core code will call them when
 * the corresponding tty port functions are called.  If they are not
 * called, the generic serial function will be used instead.
 *
 * The driver.owner field should be set to the module owner of this driver.
 * The driver.name field should be set to the name of this driver (remember
 * it will show up in sysfs, so it needs to be short and to the point.
 * Useing the module name is a good idea.)
