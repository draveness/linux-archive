Current inode allocations in the proc-fs (hex-numbers):

  00000000		reserved
  00000001-00000fff	static entries	(goners)
       001		root-ino

  00001000-00001fff	dynamic entries
  0001xxxx-7fffxxxx	pid-dir entries for pid 1-7fff
  80000000-ffffffff	unused

Goal:
	a) once we'll split the thing into several virtual filesystems we
	will get rid of magical ranges (and this file, BTW).
