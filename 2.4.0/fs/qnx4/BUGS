- Fragmented files and directories were incorrectly handled.
  Fixed 1999-12-23, Anders.

- readdir sometimes returned the same dir entry more than once.
  Fixed 1999-12-13, Anders.

- File names with a length of exactly 16 chars were handled incorrectly.
  Fixed 1999-12-11, Anders.

- Files in a subdir can't be accessed, I think that the inode information
  is not correctly copied at some point. Solved 06-06-1998, Richard.
  
- At some point the mounted device can't be unmounted. I think that somewhere
  in the code a buffer is not given free.

- Make the '..' entry work, I give it a great chance that the above bug
  (not given free) has something to do with this one, after a 'ls -l'
  the mounted device can't be unmounted and that's where the '..' entry
  is accessed.
  Seems to be solved 21-06-1998, Frank.

  Solved 21-06-1998, Frank.

  Solved 25-06-1998, Frank.

- Write/truncate/delete functions don't update the bitmap.
