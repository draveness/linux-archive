 *   struct hfs_btree *tree: pointer to the (struct hfs_btree)

 * Preconditions:
 *   'bnode' points to a "valid" (struct hfs_bnode).
 *   'tree' points to a "valid" (struct hfs_btree).
 *   'node' is an existing node number in the B-tree.
 * Postconditions:
 *   The following are true of 'bnode' upon return:
 *    The 'magic' field is set to indicate a valid (struct hfs_bnode). 
 *    The 'sticky', 'tree' and 'node' fields are initialized to the
 *    values of the of the corresponding arguments.
 *    If the 'sticky' argument is zero then the fields 'prev' and
 *    'next' are initialized by inserting the (struct hfs_bnode) in the
 *    linked list of the appropriate cache slot; otherwise they are
 *    initialized to NULL.
 *    The data is read from disk (or buffer cache) and the 'buf' field
 *    points to the buffer for that data.

 *    process was waiting on disk I/O (if necessary) then the
 *    remaining fields are zero ('count', 'resrv', 'lock') or NULL
 *    ('wqueue', 'rqueue') corresponding to no accesses.
 *    If there were access attempts during I/O then they were blocked
 *    until the I/O was complete, and the fields 'count', 'resrv',
