  This document provides answers to some of the most frequently asked
  questions about the HFS filesystem for Linux.  It is currently pretty
  rough and totally unorganized.  Corrections, additions and clarifica-
  tions are appreciated.  The most current version of this document is
  kept on The HFS for Linux Page <http://www-sccm.Stanford.EDU/~har-
  grove/HFS/>.

  11..  WWhhaatt iiss tthhiiss FFAAQQ aabboouutt??

  This FAQ is about the HFS filesystem for Linux, which is available in
  two forms.  The stand-alone version (called hfs_fs) is a Linux kernel
  loadable module implementing the Macintosh HFS filesystem.  The HFS
  filesystem is also included in some distributions of the Linux kernel
  source (in the directory linux/fs/hfs).  This version can be compiled
  as a loadable module or compiled into the kernel.

  Either version allows a machine running Linux to read and write disks
  from a Macintosh (almost) as though they were native Linux disks.

  22..  WWhhaatt iiss HHFFSS??

  HFS stands for ``Hierarchical File System'' and is the filesystem used
  by the Mac Plus and all later Macintosh models.  Earlier Macintosh
  models used MFS (``Macintosh File System''), which is not supported.

  33..  HHooww II mmoouunntt AApppplleeSShhaarree vvoolluummeess??

  The HFS filesystem is for mounting local filesystems only.  There is
  an experimental afpfs by Ben Hekster heksterb@acm.org available from
  http://www.odyssey.co.il/~heksterb/Software/afpfs/.

  As of version 1.0.3 of this FAQ, version 0.95 is the most recent.  You
  can always find the most recent version on The HFS for Linux Page
  <http://www-sccm.Stanford.EDU/~hargrove/HFS/>.  Announcements of new
  versions are made to the comp.os.linux.announce newsgroup.

  Version 0.95 is considered to be ``beta'' software, so I recommend
  making backups of anything important before you start playing.  It is
  relatively free of bugs due to lots of testing of the previous
  releases.

  After a suitable period without new bugs the I will consider the
  software to be ``stable'' and the version number will jump to 1.0.

  There is no mailing list devoted exclusively to the HFS filesystem.
  However, announcements of new versions are posted to the ``linux-
  atalk'' and ``hfs-interest'' lists.  I will see bug reports sent to
  those lists but e-mail is more reliable (hargrove@sccm.Stanford.EDU).

  To subscribe to hfs-interest send e-mail with a body of ``subscribe
  hfs-interest (your e-mail address)'' to majordomo@ccs.neu.edu.

  To subscribe to linux-atalk send e-mail with a body of ``SUBSCRIBE
  LINUX-ATALK (Your full name)'' to listserv@netspace.org.

  To compile and use the stand-alone distribution of the HFS filesystem
  you will need Linux kernel version 2.0.1 or newer compiled with
  modules enabled (CONFIG_MODULES).  To compile you will need the kernel
  headers which match the kernel you are running.  This is covered in
  more detail in the installation instructions in INSTALL.txt.

  If your kernel came with HFS in the kernel source tree then HFS should
  work with your Linux version.  There may be small problems with a few
  of the development kernel releases.  For these releases check the HFS
  for Linux Page <http://www-sccm.Stanford.EDU/~hargrove/HFS/> for
  patches.

  The code is carefully written to be independent of your processor's
  word size and byte-order, so if your machine runs Linux it can run the
  HFS filesystem.  However some younger ports don't yet have support for
  loadable modules.

  Note that HFS is tested most extensively on Intel platforms.  So there
  could be subtle compilation problems on other platforms.  If you
  encounter any that are not addressed by the documentation then please
  let me know.

  No.  There is a port in progress to NetBSD.  I know of no other active
  porting attempts.  If you are interested in porting the HFS filesystem
  to another Unix-like operating system, I am interested in providing
  what guidance I can.

  In the past there was a known incompatibility with some ``hybrid''
  CDROMs that appear as HFS disks on Macs and as ISO9660 disks on other
  systems.  I think I have fixed the problem.  So, if you encounter this
  particular problem or have problems with specific non-hybrid CDROMs
  please e-mail me with the title and manufacturer of the CD.

  This message comes from the kernel and indicates that an attempt was
  made to read a 512-byte block from a device that doesn't support
  512-byte blocks.  The HFS filesystem only works with 512-byte blocks,
  and therefore doesn't function with these devices.  Eventually it may
  be able to use 1024-byte (or even 2048-byte) blocks when necessary.
  Ideally the device driver should be enhanced to support 512-byte
  blocks so that the various filesystems which need 512-byte blocks
  don't each need to work around it.

  If your Linux kernel doesn't understand Macintosh partition tables it
  gives this warning when it can't find a partition table it recognizes.
  To support partitioned media with such kernels, decoding of Mac
  partition tables is done by the HFS filesystem so you should still be
  able to mount the disk.  However, to do so you will need to mount the
  raw device (such as /dev/sdb instead of /dev/sdb4) and use the part
  mount option to indicate which partition you want.

  1133..  CCaann II mmoouunntt mmuullttiippllee HHFFSS ppaarrttiittiioonnss ffrroomm tthhee ssaammee MMaacciinnttoosshh ddiisskk??

  Only if your kernel understands Macintosh partition tables.  It the
  kernel doesn't understand the Macintosh partition table, the HFS
  filesystem must access the raw device.  Therefore, the kernel thinks
  the entire drive is in use and prevents additional mounts on it.

  The HFS filesystem is as capable as the MS-DOS or VFAT filesystems,
  except that certain things can only be done with a file's data fork.

  You ccaann:

  +o  Create, delete and rename directories and data forks of files with
     the caveat that names are case insensitive (so foo and Foo are the
     same file or directory).

  +o  Run Linux executables or shared libraries on an HFS disk if they
     are stored in the data fork of a file.

  +o  Read, write and truncate both forks of files and the Finder's
     metadata of files and directories.

  +o  Mmap data forks of files (and the resource fork if the filesystem
     is mounted with the fork=cap option).

  +o  Toggle the 'w' permission bits (as a group) of data forks.

  +o  Change the i_mtime of files and directories.

  You ccaannnnoott:

  +o  Create, delete or rename resource forks of files or the Finder's
     metadata.  Note, however, that they are created (with defaults
     values), deleted and renamed along with the corresponding data fork
     or directory.

  +o  Run Linux executables or shared libraries on an HFS disk if they
     are stored in the resource fork of a file.

  +o  Mmap the Finder's metadata (when fork=cap) or AppleDouble header
     files (when fork=double or fork=netatalk).

  +o  Change permissions on directories.

  +o  Change the uid or gid of files or directories.

  +o  Set the set-uid, set-gid or sticky permission bits.

  +o  Create multiple links to files.

  +o  Create symlinks, device files, sockets or FIFOs.

  ddiisskkeetttteess??

  Yes and no.  The software is fully capable of dealing with HFS disks
  of any size.  However, the 400k and 800k diskettes are written in a
  physical format that is incompatible with most non-Macintosh floppy
  drives.  Note also that almost all 400k Macintosh diskettes are MFS,
  not HFS.

  Robert Leslie (rob@mars.org) has written a package for working with
  HFS filesystems (like mtools plus a graphical interface).  One program
  in the package is hformat which can format HFS filesystems.  The
  latest version can be found on the HFS Utilities home page
  <http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/hfs/>.

  Right now you'll have to use a Macintosh to do this.  However, Rob
  Leslie is working on an fsck for HFS filesystems.

  To be compatible with netatalk's afpd you will need to use netatalk
  version 1.4b1 or newer and mount the HFS filesystem with the ``afpd''
  mount option.  More information is provided in the ``afpd'' subsection
  of the ``Mount Options'' section of the HFS documentation (HFS.txt if
  you have the stand-alone HFS distribution or
  linux/Documentation/filesystems/hfs.txt if HFS is in your kernel
  source tree.)

  1199..  WWhhyy ddooeess mmyy MMaacciinnttoosshh sshhooww ggeenneerriicc aapppplliiccaattiioonn aanndd ddooccuummeenntt
  iiccoonnss??

  When using the ``afpd'' mount option the Desktop database on the disk
  is not made available to Netatalk's afpd.  Because of this mounting an
  HFS filesystem across the network to a Macintosh may result in the
  Finder showing generic application and document icons.  Additionally
  double clicking on a document will fail to start the correct
  application.

  If the disk is writable you can make Netatalk build a new Desktop
  database in its own format by holding down the Option key while
  selecting the volume in the Chooser.  If the disk is not writable then
  these problems can be worked around by copying the application to a
  local disk on the Macintosh.
