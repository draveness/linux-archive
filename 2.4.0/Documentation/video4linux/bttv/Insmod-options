bttv.o
	the bt848 (grabber chip) driver

	insmod args:
		card=n		card type, see CARDLIST for a list.
		tuner=n		tuner type, see CARDLIST for a list.
		radio=0/1	card supports radio
		pll=0/1/2	pll settings
			0: don't use PLL
			1: 28 MHz crystal installed
			2: 35 MHz crystal installed
		triton1=0/1     for Triton1 compatibility
				Triton1 is automatically recognized
				but this might also help with other chipsets
		bigendian=n	Set the endianness of the gfx framebuffer.
				Default is native endian.
		fieldnr=0/1	Count fields.  Some TV descrambling software
				needs this, for others it only generates
				50 useless IRQs/sec.  default is 0 (off).
		autoload=0/1	autoload helper modules (tuner, audio).
				default is 1 (on).
		bttv_verbose=0/1/2  verbose level (at insmod time, while looking
				at the hardware).  default is 1.
		bttv_debug=0/1	debug messages (for capture).
				default is 0 (off).
		irq_debug=0/1	irq handler debug messages.
				default is 0 (off).
		gbuffers=2-64	number of capture buffers for mmap'ed capture.
				default is 2.
		gbufsize=	size of capture buffers. default and
				maximum value is 0x208000 (~2MB)

		bttv_gpio=0/1
		gpiomask=
		audioall=
		audiomux=
				See Sound-FAQ for a detailed description.

	remap, card, radio and pll accept up to four comma-separated arguments
	(for multiple boards).

tuner.o
	The tuner driver.  You need this unless you want to use only
	with a camera or external tuner ...

	insmod args:
		debug=1		print some debug info to the syslog
		type=n		type of the tuner chip. n as follows:
				see CARDLIST for a complete list.

tvmixer.o
	registers a mixer device for the TV card's volume/bass/treble
	controls (requires a i2c audio control chip like the msp3400).

	insmod args:
		debug=1		print some debug info to the syslog.
		devnr=n		allocate device #n (0 == /dev/mixer,
				1 = /dev/mixer1, ...), default is to
				use the first free one.

tvaudio.o
	new, experimental module which is supported to provide a single
	driver for all simple i2c audio control chips (tda/tea*).

	insmod args:
		tda8425  = 1	enable/disable the support for the
		tda9840  = 1	various chips.
		tda9850  = 1	The tea6300 can't be autodetected and is
		tda9855  = 1	therefore off by default, if you have
		tda9873  = 1	this one on your card (STB uses these)
		tea6300  = 0	you have to enable it explicitly.
		tea6420  = 1	The two tda985x chips use the same i2c
		pic16c54 = 1	address and can't be disturgished from
				each other, you might have to disable
				the wrong one.
		debug = 1	print debug messages

msp3400.o
	The driver for the msp34xx sound processor chips. If you have a
	stereo card, you probably want to insmod this one.

	insmod args:
		debug=1/2	print some debug info to the syslog,
				2 is more verbose.
		simple=1	Use the "short programming" method.  Newer
				msp34xx versions support this.  You need this
				for dbx stereo.  Default is on if supported by
				the chip.
		once=1		Don't check the TV-stations Audio mode
				every few seconds, but only once after
				channel switches.
		amsound=1	Audio carrier is AM/NICAM at 6.5 Mhz.  This
				should improve things for french people, the
				carrier autoscan seems to work with FM only...

tea6300.o - OBSOLETE (use tvaudio instead)
	The driver for the tea6300 fader chip.  If you have a stereo
	card and the msp3400.o doesn't work, you might want to try this
	one.  This chip is seen on most STB TV/FM cards (usually from
	Gateway OEM sold surplus on auction sites).

	insmod args:
		debug=1		print some debug info to the syslog.

tda8425.o - OBSOLETE (use tvaudio instead)
	The driver for the tda8425 fader chip.  This driver used to be
	part of bttv.c, so if your sound used to work but does not
	anymore, try loading this module.

	insmod args:
		debug=1		print some debug info to the syslog.

tda985x.o - OBSOLETE (use tvaudio instead)
	The driver for the tda9850/55 audio chips.

	insmod args:
		debug=1		print some debug info to the syslog.
		chip=9850/9855	set the chip type.
