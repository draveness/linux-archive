This document describes the eicon driver for the
Eicon active ISDN cards.

It is meant to be used with isdn4linux, an ISDN link-level module for Linux.

Supported Cards
===============

Old ISA type
------------
- S-Card ISA
- SX-Card ISA
- SXn-Card ISA
- SCOM-Card ISA
- Quadro-Card ISA
- S2M-Card ISA

DIVA Server family
------------------
- DIVA Server BRI/PCI 2M
- DIVA Server PRI/PCI 2M (9M 23M 30M)
- DIVA Server 4BRI/PCI
	supported functions of onboard DSPs:
	- analog modem
	- fax group 2/3 (Fax Class 2 commands)
	- DTMF detection


ISDN D-Channel Protocols
------------------------

- ETSI (Euro-DSS1) 
- 1TR6 (German ISDN) *not testet*
- other protocols exist for the range of DIVA Server cards,
  but they are not fully testet yet.


You can load the module simply by using the insmod or modprobe function :

  insmod eicon [id=driverid] [membase=<membase>] [irq=<irq>]


The module will automatically probe the PCI-cards. If the id-option
is omitted, the driver will assume 'eicon0' for the first pci card and
increases the digit with each further card. With a given driver-id
the module appends a number starting with '0'.

For ISA-cards you have to specify membase, irq and id. If id or
membase is missing/invalid, the driver will not be loaded except
PCI-cards were found. Additional ISA-cards and irq/membase changes
can be done with the eiconctrl utility.

After loading the module, you have to download the protocol and
dsp-code by using the eiconctrl utility of isdn4k-utils.


Example for loading and starting a BRI card with E-DSS1 Protocol.

	eiconctrl [-d DriverId] load etsi

Example for a BRI card with E-DSS1 Protocol with PtP configuration.

	eiconctrl [-d DriverId] load etsi -n -t1 -s1


Example for loading and starting a PRI card with E-DSS1 Protocol.

	eiconctrl [-d DriverId] load etsi -s2 -n


Details about using the eiconctrl utility are in 'man eiconctrl'
or will be printed by starting eiconctrl without any parameters.

ISDNLOG:
With eicon driver version 1.77 or newer and the eiconctrl utility
of version 1.1 or better, you can use the isdnlog user program
with your DIVA Server BRI card.
Just use "eiconctrl isdnlog on" and the driver will generate
the necessary D-Channel traces for isdnlog.


FILECHECK:
A part of the eicon driver source code files are provided
by Eicon Technology. In order to get the best support from Eicon,
these files are tested with a checksum, just to know if the files
were modified. This does *not* mean, you are not allowed to modify the
driver. If you want to improve the driver or you fix a bug, please do
so and let me (or Eicon) know, about the necessary changes. So
every user knows, if the driver he uses is modified or checked with
Eicon files. When the driver has been loaded, in the syslog you will
find something like "verified" or "modified" right after the version.


Thanks to 
	Deutsche Mailbox Saar-Lor-Lux GmbH
	for sponsoring and testing fax
	capabilities with Diva Server cards.


Any reports about bugs, errors and even wishes are welcome.


Have fun !
