ADS GraphicsClient/ThinClient Single Board Computer

For more details, contact Applied Data Systems or see

The original Linux support for this product has been provided by 
Nicolas Pitre <nico@cam.org>.

It's currently possible to mount a root filesystem via NFS providing a
complete Linux environment.  Otherwise a ramdisk image may be used.  Use
'make graphicsclient_config' before any 'make config'.  This will set up
defaults for GraphicsClient/ThinClient support.

The kernel zImage is linked to be loaded and executed at 0xc0200000.  
Also the following registers should have the specified values upon entry:

	r0 = 0
	r1 = 29	(this is the GraphicsClient architecture number)

Here is a tipical angel.opt option file if the kernel is loaded through
the Angel Debug Monitor:

----- begin angelboot.opt -----
base 0xc0200000
entry 0xc0200000
r0 0x00000000
r1 0x0000001d
device /dev/ttyS1
options "9600 8N1"
baud 115200
#otherfile ramdisk.gz
#otherbase 0xc0800000
exec minicom
----- end angelboot.opt -----

Then the kernel (and ramdisk if otherfile/otherbase lines above are
uncommented) would be loaded with:

	angelboot -f angelboot.opt zImage

Here it is assumed that the board is connected to ttyS1 on your PC
and that minicom is preconfigured with /dev/ttyS1, 9600 baud, 8N1, no flow
control by default.

If any other bootloader is used, ensure it accomplish the same, especially
for r0/r1 register values before jumping into the kernel.


Supported peripherals:
- SA1100 LCD frame buffer (only 8bpp yet)
- on-board SMC 92C94 ethernet NIC
- SA1100 serial port
- flash memory access
- pcmcia
- possibly UCB1200 audio (not tested yet)

To do:
- touchscreen driver
- 16bpp frame buffer support
- extra (external) serial port driver
- some console keyboard support (maybe IR?)
- everything else!  :-)

Any contribution can be sent to nico@cam.org and will be greatly welcome!
