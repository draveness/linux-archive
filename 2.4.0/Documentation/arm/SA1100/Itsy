Itsy is a research project done by the Western Research Lab, and Systems
Research Center in Palo Alto, CA. The Itsy project is one of several
research projects at Compaq that are related to pocket computing.

Itsy support has yet to be fully integrated in this kernel.  Linux 2.0.x
support is available though.
