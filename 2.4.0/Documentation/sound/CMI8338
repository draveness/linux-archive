DRIVER PARAMETERS
================================================================================

  Some functions for the cm8738 can be configured in Kernel Configuration
  or modules parameters. Set these parameters to 1 to enable.

  spdif_loop:   Enable S/PDIF loop, this route S/PDIF-in to S/PDIF-out
                directly.
  four_ch:      Enable 4 channels mode, rear-out or line-in will output
                the same as line-out.
  rear_out:     Enable this if you have independent rear-out jacket on
                your sound card, otherwise line-in will be used as
                rear-out.
  modem:	You will need to set this parameter if you want to use
		the HSP modem. You need install the pctel.o, the modem
		driver itself.

  (You will need to get the pctel driver (binary only) and the support for
  this option from the CMI site. It is not included in the Linux kernel 
  proper as it is non-free).
