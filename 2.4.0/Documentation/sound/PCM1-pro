In Documentation/sound/README.OSS was a remark saying noone was sure the
mixer on the PCM1-pro worked with the ACI driver. Well, it does.
I've been using the drivers for the MAD16 and the driver for the mixer
since kernel 2.0.32 with a MiroSound PCM1-pro and it works great.

I've got it working with the following configuration:

MAD16 audio I/O base = 530
MAD16  audio IRQ = 7
MAD16 Audio DMA = 1
MAD16 MIDI I/O = 330
MAD16 MIDI IRQ = 9

And I've enabled the ACI mixer (miro PCM12) .
