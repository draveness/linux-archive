UDF Filesystem version 0.9.1

If you encounter problems with reading UDF discs using this driver,
please report them to linux_udf@hootie.lvld.hp.com, which is the
developer's list.

Write support requires a block driver which supports writing. The current
scsi and ide cdrom drivers do not support writing.

The following mount options are supported:

	gid=		Set the default group.
	umask=		Set the default umask.
	uid=		Set the default user.

	unhide		Show otherwise hidden files.
	undelete	Show deleted files in lists.

	noadinicb	Don't embed data in the inode
	shortad		Use short ad's
	longad		Use long ad's (default)
	strict		Set strict conformance (unused)

The remaining are for debugging and disaster recovery:

	novrs		Skip volume sequence recognition 

The following expect a offset from 0.

	session=	Set the CDROM session (default= last session)

	volume=		Override the VolumeDesc location. (unused)
	partition=	Override the PartitionDesc location. (unused)
