This is a list of things to be done for better devfs support in the
Linux kernel. If you'd like to contribute to the devfs, please have a
look at this list for anything that is unallocated. Also, if there are
items missing (surely), please contact me so I can add them to the
list (preferably with your name attached to them:-).
