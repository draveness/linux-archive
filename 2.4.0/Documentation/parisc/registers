Register Usage for Linux/PA-RISC

[ an asterisk is used for planned usage which is currently unimplemented ]

	General Registers as specified by ABI

	FPU Registers must not be used in kernel mode

	Control Registers

CR 0 (Recovery Counter)		used for ptrace
CR 1-CR 7(undefined)		unused
CR 8 (Protection ID)		per-process value*
CR 9, 12, 13 (PIDS)		unused
CR10 (CCR)			lazy FPU saving*
CR11				as specified by ABI
CR14 (interruption vector)	initialized to fault_vector
CR15 (EIEM)			initialized to all ones*
CR16 (Interval Timer)		timer interrupt
CR17-CR22			interruption parameters
CR23 (EIRR)			read for pending interrupts
CR24 (TR 0)			Kernel Space Page Directory Pointer
CR25 (TR 1)			User   Space Page Directory Pointer
CR26 (TR 2)
CR27 (TR 3)
CR28 (TR 4)			used by interruption handlers
CR29 (TR 5)			used by interruption handlers
CR30 (TR 6)			current / 0
CR31 (TR 7)			used by interruption handlers

	Space Registers (kernel mode)

SR0				temporary space register
SR4-SR7 			set to 0
SR1				temporary space register
SR2				unused
SR3				used for userspace accesses (current process)*

	Space Registers (user mode)

SR0				temporary space register
SR1                             temporary space register
SR2                             holds space of linux gateway page
SR3                             holds user address space value while in kernel
SR4-SR7                         Defines short address space for user/kernel

For the general registers:

r1,r2,r19-r26,r28,r29 & r31 can be used without saving them first. And of
course, you need to save them if you care about them, before calling
another procedure. Some of the above registers do have special meanings
that you should be aware of:

    r1: The addil instruction is hardwired to place its result in r1,
	so if you use that instruction be aware of that.

    r2: This is the return pointer. In general you don't want to
	use this, since you need the pointer to get back to your
	caller. However, it is grouped with this set of registers
	since the caller can't rely on the value being the same
	when you return, i.e. you can copy r2 to another register
	and return through that register after trashing r2, and
	that should not cause a problem for the calling routine.

    r19-r22: these are generally regarded as temporary registers.
	Note that in 64 bit they are arg7-arg4.

    r23-r26: these are arg3-arg0, i.e. you can use them if you
	don't care about the values that were passed in anymore.

    r28,r29: are ret0 and ret1. They are what you pass return values
	in. r28 is the primary return. I'm not sure I remember
	under what circumstances stuff is returned in r29 (millicode
	perhaps).

    r31: the ble instruction puts the return pointer in here.


r3-r18,r27,r30 need to be saved and restored. r3-r18 are just
    general purpose registers. r27 is the data pointer, and is
    used to make references to global variables easier. r30 is
    the stack pointer.
