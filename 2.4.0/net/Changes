Possible projects for victim^H^H^H^H^Holunteers

9.	Implementing streams. Not as a blind slow SYS5.4 style copy but actually
working out how to do it so it runs like greased lightning. Quite a big
problem. [See the LiS project]

11.	IP over SCSI. [worked on]

14.	Bidirectional PLIP. Also PLIP for the newer style parallel ports.

15.	802.2LLC and thus Netbeui sockets. Becoming less important since the
rumour is microsoft are phasing out netbeui for netbios/IP. Microsoft have
gone for netbios/funny-ipx-variant it seems in Win95, but TCP is selectable.

17.	PPP multilink. Another nasty job.

19.	IPv4 IP-AH and IP-ESP.

20.	(userspace) GUI interface to the bandwidth allocators so mere
	mortals can do this


BTW: Don't let the magic words 'kernel programming' worry you. Its like DOS
- you make a mistake you have to reboot. You do at least get dumps and a
kernel logger that is reliable. There is now a loadable module allowing
use of gdb on the kernel (no breakpoints though!). No magic involved.
