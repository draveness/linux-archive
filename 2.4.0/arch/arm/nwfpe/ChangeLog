	* fpmodule.c - Changed version number to 0.95
	* fpa11.h - modified FPA11, FPREG structures
	* fpa11.c - Changes due to FPA11, FPREG structure alterations.
	* fpa11_cpdo.c - Changes due to FPA11, FPREG structure alterations.
	* fpa11_cpdt.c - Changes due to FPA11, FPREG structure alterations.
	* fpa11_cprt.c - Changes due to FPA11, FPREG structure alterations.
	* single_cpdo.c - Changes due to FPA11, FPREG structure alterations.
	* double_cpdo.c - Changes due to FPA11, FPREG structure alterations.
	* extended_cpdo.c - Changes due to FPA11, FPREG structure alterations.

	* I discovered several bugs.  First and worst is that the kernel
	  passes in a pointer to the FPE's state area.	This is defined
	  as a struct user_fp (see user.h).  This pointer was cast to a
	  FPA11*.  Unfortunately FPA11 and user_fp are of different sizes;
	  user_fp is smaller.  This meant that the FPE scribbled on things
	  below its area, which is bad, as the area is in the thread_struct
	  embedded in the process task structure.  Thus we were scribbling
	  over one of the most important structures in the entire OS.

	* user_fp and FPA11 have now been harmonized.  Most of the changes
	  in the above code were dereferencing problems due to moving the
	  register type out of FPREG, and getting rid of the union variable
	  fpvalue.

	* Second I noticed resetFPA11 was not always being called for a
	  task.  This should happen on the first floating point exception
	  that occurs.	It is controlled by init_flag in FPA11.  The
	  comment in the code beside init_flag state the kernel guarantees
	  this to be zero.  Not so.  I found that the kernel recycles task
	  structures, and that recycled ones may not have init_flag zeroed.
	  I couldn't even find anything that guarantees it is zeroed when
	  when the task structure is initially allocated.  In any case
	  I now initialize the entire FPE state in the thread structure to
	  zero when allocated and recycled.  See alloc_task_struct() and
	  flush_thread() in arch/arm/process.c.  The change to
	  alloc_task_struct() may not be necessary, but I left it in for
	  completeness (better safe than sorry).
