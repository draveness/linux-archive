/* How timers work:
 *
 * On uniprocessors we just use counter zero for the system wide
 * ticker, this performs thread scheduling, clock book keeping,
 * and runs timer based events.  Previously we used the Ultra
 * %tick interrupt for this purpose.
 *
 * On multiprocessors we pick one cpu as the master level 10 tick
 * processor.  Here this counter zero tick handles clock book
 * keeping and timer events only.  Each Ultra has it's level
 * 14 %tick interrupt set to fire off as well, even the master
 * tick cpu runs this locally.  This ticker performs thread
 * scheduling, system/user tick counting for the current thread,
 * and also profiling if enabled.

/* Two timers, traditionally steered to PIL's 10 and 14 respectively.
 * But since INO packets are used on sun5, we could use any PIL level
 * we like, however for now we use the normal ones.
 *
 * The 'reg' and 'interrupts' properties for these live in nodes named
 * 'counter-timer'.  The first of three 'reg' properties describe where
 * the sun5_timer registers are.  The other two I have no idea. (XXX)
