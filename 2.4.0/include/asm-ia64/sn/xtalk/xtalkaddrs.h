/*
 * CrossTalk to SN0 Hub addressing support
 *
 * This file defines the mapping conventions used by the Hub's
 * I/O interface when it receives a read or write request from 
 * a CrossTalk widget.  
 *
 * Format for non-Memory accesses:
 *
 *  +--------------+------------------------------------------------+
 *  | 0  | XXXXX   |        SN0Addr                                |
 *  +----+---------+------------------------------------------------+
 *    47  46     40 39                                             0
 *	bit 47 indicates Memory (0)
 *	bits 46..40 are unused
 *	bits 39..0 hold the memory address
 *			(bits 39..31 hold the nodeID in N mode
 *			 bits 39..32 hold the nodeID in M mode
 * By design, this looks exactly like a 0-extended SN0 Address, so
 * we don't need to do any conversions.
 *
 *
 *
 * Format for non-Memory accesses:
 *
 *  +--------------+------+---------+------+--+---------------------+
 *  | 1  | DstNode | XXXX | BigW=0  | SW=1 | 1|   Addr              |
 *  +----+---------+------+---------+------+--+---------------------+
 *    47  46     38 37  31 30     28 27  24 23 22                  0
 *
 *	bit 47 indicates IO (1)
 *      bits 46..38 hold the destination node ID
 *      bits 37..31 are unused
 *      bits 30..28 hold the big window being addressed
 *      bits 27..24 hold the small window being addressed
 *                  0 always refers to the xbow
 *                  1 always refers to the hub itself
 *      bit 23 indicates local (0) or remote (1)
 *             no accessing checks are done if this bit is 0
 *      bits 22..0 hold the register address
 *                 bits 22..21 determine which section of the hub
 *                              00 -> PI
 *                              01 -> MD
 *                              10 -> IO
 *                              11 -> NI
 * This looks very much like a REMOTE_HUB access, except the nodeID
 * is in a different place, and the highest xtalk bit is set.
