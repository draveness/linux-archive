 * current 8MB value just means that there will be a 8MB "hole" after the
 * physical memory until the kernel virtual memory starts.  That means that
 * any out-of-bounds memory accesses will hopefully be caught.
 * The vmalloc() routines leaves a hole of 4kB between each vmalloced
 * area for the same reason. ;)
