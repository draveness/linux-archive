 * shift. The structure should be always cache line aligned.
 * gcc needs n=alignto(cachelinesize, popcnt(sizeof(bla_mib))) shift/add instructions
 * to emulate multiply in case it is not power-of-two. Currently n is always <=3 for
 * all sizes so simple cache line alignment is enough. 
 * 
 * The best solution would be a global CPU local area , especially on 64 and 128byte
