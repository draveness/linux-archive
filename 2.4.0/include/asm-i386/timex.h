 * Standard way to access the cycle counter on i586+ CPUs.
 * Currently only used on SMP.
 *
 * If you really have a SMP machine with i486 chips or older,
 * compile for that, and this will just always return zero.
 * That's ok, it just means that the nicer scheduling heuristics
 * won't work for you.
 *
 * We only use the low 32 bits, and we'd simply better make sure
 * that we reschedule before that wraps. Scheduling at least every
