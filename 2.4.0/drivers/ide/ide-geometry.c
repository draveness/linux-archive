 * We query CMOS about hard disks : it could be that we have a SCSI/ESDI/etc
 * controller that is BIOS compatible with ST-506, and thus showing up in our
 * BIOS table, but not register compatible, and therefore not present in CMOS.
 *
 * Furthermore, we will assume that our ST-506 drives <if any> are the primary
 * drives in the system -- the ones reflected as drive 1 or 2.  The first
 * drive is stored in the high nibble of CMOS byte 0x12, the second in the low
 * nibble.  This will be either a 4 bit drive type or 0xf indicating use byte
 * 0x19 for an 8 bit type, drive 1, 0x1a for drive 2 in CMOS.  A non-zero value
 * means we have an AT controller hard disk for that drive.
 *
 * Of course, there is no guarantee that either drive is actually on the
 * "primary" IDE interface, but we don't bother trying to sort that out here.
 * If a drive is not actually on the primary interface, then these parameters
 * will be ignored.  This results in the user having to supply the logical
 * drive geometry as a boot parameter for each drive not on the primary i/f.

/*
 * The only "perfect" way to handle this would be to modify the setup.[cS] code
 * to do BIOS calls Int13h/Fn08h and Int13h/Fn48h to get all of the drive info
 * for us during initialization.  I have the necessary docs -- any takers?  -ml

/*
 * I did this, but it doesnt work - there is no reasonable way to find the
 * correspondence between the BIOS numbering of the disks and the Linux

 *
 * The code below is bad. One of the problems is that drives 1 and 2
 * may be SCSI disks (even when IDE disks are present), so that
 * the geometry we read here from BIOS is attributed to the wrong disks.
 * Consequently, also the former "drive->present = 1" below was a mistake.
 *
 * Eventually the entire routine below should be removed.

 * (ii) to invent a translated geometry.
 * Part (i) is suppressed if the user specifies the "noremap" option
 * on the command line.
 * Part (ii) is suppressed if the user specifies an explicit geometry.
 *
 * The ptheads parameter is either 0 or tells about the number of
 * heads shown by the end of the first nonempty partition.
 * If this is either 16, 32, 64, 128, 240 or 255 we'll believe it.
 *
 * The xparm parameter has the following meaning:
 *	 0 = convert to CHS with fewer than 1024 cyls
 *	     using the same method as Ontrack DiskManager.
 *	 1 = same as "0", plus offset everything by 63 sectors.
 *	-1 = similar to "0", plus redirect sector 0 to sector 1.
 *	 2 = convert to a CHS geometry with "ptheads" heads.
 *
 * Returns 0 if the translation was not possible, if the device was not 
 * an IDE disk drive, or if a geometry was "forced" on the commandline.
 * Returns 1 if the geometry translation was successful.
