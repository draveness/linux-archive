    This is a device driver for the 3Com Etherlink 3c501.
    Do not purchase this card, even as a joke.  It's performance is horrible,
    and it breaks in many ways.

    Fixed (again!) the missing interrupt locking on TX/RX shifting.
    		Alan Cox <Alan.Cox@linux.org>

    Removed calls to init_etherdev since they are no longer needed, and
    cleaned up modularization just a bit. The driver still allows only
    the default address for cards when loaded as a module, but that's
    really less braindead than anyone using a 3c501 board. :)
		    19950208 (invid@msen.com)

    Added traps for interrupts hitting the window as we clear and TX load
    the board. Now getting 150K/second FTP with a 3c501 card. Still playing
    with a TX-TX optimisation to see if we can touch 180-200K/second as seems
    theoretically maximum.
    		19950402 Alan Cox <Alan.Cox@linux.org>
    		
    Cleaned up for 2.3.x because we broke SMP now.

/**
 * DOC: 3c501 Card Notes
 *
 *  Some notes on this thing if you have to hack it.  [Alan]
 *
 *  Some documentation is available from 3Com. Due to the boards age
 *  standard responses when you ask for this will range from 'be serious'
 *  to 'give it to a museum'. The documentation is incomplete and mostly
 *  of historical interest anyway. 
 *
 *  The basic system is a single buffer which can be used to receive or
 *  transmit a packet. A third command mode exists when you are setting
 *  things up.
 *
 *  If it's transmitting it's not receiving and vice versa. In fact the
 *  time to get the board back into useful state after an operation is
 *  quite large.
 *
 *  The driver works by keeping the board in receive mode waiting for a
 *  packet to arrive. When one arrives it is copied out of the buffer
 *  and delivered to the kernel. The card is reloaded and off we go.
 *
 *  When transmitting lp->txing is set and the card is reset (from
 *  receive mode) [possibly losing a packet just received] to command
 *  mode. A packet is loaded and transmit mode triggered. The interrupt
 *  handler runs different code for transmit interrupts and can handle
 *  returning to receive mode or retransmissions (yes you have to help
 *  out with those too).
 *
 * DOC: Problems
 *  
 *  There are a wide variety of undocumented error returns from the card
 *  and you basically have to kick the board and pray if they turn up. Most
 *  only occur under extreme load or if you do something the board doesn't
 *  like (eg touching a register at the wrong time).
 *
 *  The driver is less efficient than it could be. It switches through
 *  receive mode even if more transmits are queued. If this worries you buy
 *  a real Ethernet card.
 *
 *  The combination of slow receive restart and no real multicast
 *  filter makes the board unusable with a kernel compiled for IP
 *  multicasting in a real multicast environment. That's down to the board,
 *  but even with no multicast programs running a multicast IP kernel is
 *  in group 224.0.0.1 and you will therefore be listening to all multicasts.
 *  One nv conference running over that Ethernet and you can give up.
