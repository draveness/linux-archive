 *	linux/drivers/sbus/char/aurora.h -- Aurora multiport driver
 *
 *	Copyright (c) 1999 by Oliver Aldulea (oli@bv.ro)
 *
 *	This code is based on the RISCom/8 multiport serial driver written
 *	by Dmitry Gorodchanin (pgmdsg@ibi.com), based on the Linux serial
 *	driver, written by Linus Torvalds, Theodore T'so and others.
 *	The Aurora multiport programming info was obtained mainly from the
 *	Cirrus Logic CD180 documentation (available on the web), and by
 *	doing heavy tests on the board. Many thanks to Eddie C. Dost for the
 *	help on the sbus interface.

 *
 *	Revision 1.0
 *
 *	This is the first public release.
 *
 *	This version needs a lot of feedback. This is the version that works
 *	with _my_ board. My board is model 1600se, revision '@(#)1600se.fth
 *	1.2 3/28/95 1'. The driver might work with your board, but I do not
 *	guarantee it. If you have _any_ type of board, I need to know if the
 *	driver works or not, I need to know exactly your board parameters
 *	(get them with 'cd /proc/openprom/iommu/sbus/sio16/; ls *; cat *')
 *	Also, I need your board revision code, which is written on the board.
 *	Send me the output of my driver too (it outputs through klogd).
 *
 *	If the driver does not work, you can try enabling the debug options
 *	to see what's wrong or what should be done.
 *
 *	I'm sorry about the alignment of the code. It was written in a
 *	128x48 environment.
 *
 *	I must say that I do not like Aurora Technologies' policy. I asked
 *	them to help me do this driver faster, but they ended by something
 *	like "don't call us, we'll call you", and I never heard anything
 *	from them. They told me "knowing the way the board works, I don't
 *	doubt you and others on the net will make the driver."
 *	The truth about this board is that it has nothing intelligent on it.
 *	If you want to say to somebody what kind of board you have, say that
 *	it uses Cirrus Logic processors (CD180). The power of the board is
 *	in those two chips. The rest of the board is the interface to the
 *	sbus and to the peripherals. Still, they did something smart: they
 *	reversed DTR and RTS to make on-board automatic hardware flow
 *	control usable.
 *	Thanks to Aurora Technologies for wasting my time, nerves and money.

 * the flow should be controlled. The first case is when the kernel is so
 * busy that it cannot process IRQ's in time; this flow control can only be
 * activated by the on-board chip, and if the board has RTS and DTR swapped,
 * this facility is usable. The second case is when the application is so
 * busy that it cannot receive bytes from the kernel, and this flow must be
 * activated by software. This second case is not yet implemented in this
 * driver. Unfortunately, I estimate that the second case is the one that
 * occurs the most.
