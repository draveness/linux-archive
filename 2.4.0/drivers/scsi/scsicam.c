 * ANNEX A :
 *
 * setsize() converts a read capacity value to int 13h
 * head-cylinder-sector requirements. It minimizes the value for
 * number of heads and maximizes the number of cylinders. This
 * will support rather large disks before the number of heads
 * will not fit in 4 bits (or 6 bits). This algorithm also
 * minimizes the number of sectors that will be unused at the end
 * of the disk while allowing for very large disks to be
 * accommodated. This algorithm does not use physical geometry.
