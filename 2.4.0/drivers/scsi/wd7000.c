 *	closely related to the aha1542 driver from Tommy Thorn
 *	( as close as different hardware allows on a lowlevel-driver :-) )
 *
 *  Revised (and renamed) by John Boyd <boyd@cis.ohio-state.edu> to
 *  accommodate Eric Youngdale's modifications to scsi.c.  Nov 1992.
 *
 *  Additional changes to support scatter/gather.  Dec. 1992.  tw/jb
 *
 *  No longer tries to reset SCSI bus at boot (it wasn't working anyway).
 *  Rewritten to support multiple host adapters.
 *  Miscellaneous cleanup.
 *  So far, still doesn't do reset or abort correctly, since I have no idea
 *  how to do them with this board (8^(.                      Jan 1994 jb
 *
 * This driver now supports both of the two standard configurations (per
 * the 3.36 Owner's Manual, my latest reference) by the same method as
 * before; namely, by looking for a BIOS signature.  Thus, the location of
 * the BIOS signature determines the board configuration.  Until I have
 * time to do something more flexible, users should stick to one of the
 * following:
 *
 * Standard configuration for single-adapter systems:
 *    - BIOS at CE00h
 *    - I/O base address 350h
 *    - IRQ level 15
 *    - DMA channel 6
 * Standard configuration for a second adapter in a system:
 *    - BIOS at C800h
 *    - I/O base address 330h
 *    - IRQ level 11
 *    - DMA channel 5
 *
 * Anyone who can recompile the kernel is welcome to add others as need
 * arises, but unpredictable results may occur if there are conflicts.
 * In any event, if there are multiple adapters in a system, they MUST
 * use different I/O bases, IRQ levels, and DMA channels, since they will be
 * indistinguishable (and in direct conflict) otherwise.
 *
 *   As a point of information, the NO_OP command toggles the CMD_RDY bit
 * of the status port, and this fact could be used as a test for the I/O
 * base address (or more generally, board detection).  There is an interrupt
 * status port, so IRQ probing could also be done.  I suppose the full
 * DMA diagnostic could be used to detect the DMA channel being used.  I
 * haven't done any of this, though, because I think there's too much of
 * a chance that such explorations could be destructive, if some other
 * board's resources are used inadvertently.  So, call me a wimp, but I
 * don't want to try it.  The only kind of exploration I trust is memory
 * exploration, since it's more certain that reading memory won't be
 * destructive.
 *
 * More to my liking would be a LILO boot command line specification, such
 * as is used by the aha152x driver (and possibly others).  I'll look into
 * it, as I have time...
 *
 *   I get mail occasionally from people who either are using or are
 * considering using a WD7000 with Linux.  There is a variety of
 * nomenclature describing WD7000's.  To the best of my knowledge, the
 * following is a brief summary (from an old WD doc - I don't work for
 * them or anything like that):
 *
 * WD7000-FASST2: This is a WD7000 board with the real-mode SST ROM BIOS
 *        installed.  Last I heard, the BIOS was actually done by Columbia
 *        Data Products.  The BIOS is only used by this driver (and thus
 *        by Linux) to identify the board; none of it can be executed under
 *        Linux.
 *
 * WD7000-ASC: This is the original adapter board, with or without BIOS.
 *        The board uses a WD33C93 or WD33C93A SBIC, which in turn is
 *        controlled by an onboard Z80 processor.  The board interface
 *        visible to the host CPU is defined effectively by the Z80's
 *        firmware, and it is this firmware's revision level that is
 *        determined and reported by this driver.  (The version of the
 *        on-board BIOS is of no interest whatsoever.)  The host CPU has
 *        no access to the SBIC; hence the fact that it is a WD33C93 is
 *        also of no interest to this driver.
 *
 * WD7000-AX:
 * WD7000-MX:
 * WD7000-EX: These are newer versions of the WD7000-ASC.  The -ASC is
 *        largely built from discrete components; these boards use more
 *        integration.  The -AX is an ISA bus board (like the -ASC),
 *        the -MX is an MCA (i.e., PS/2) bus board), and the -EX is an
 *        EISA bus board.
 *
 *  At the time of my documentation, the -?X boards were "future" products,
 *  and were not yet available.  However, I vaguely recall that Thomas
 *  Wuensche had an -AX, so I believe at least it is supported by this
 *  driver.  I have no personal knowledge of either -MX or -EX boards.
 *
 *  P.S. Just recently, I've discovered (directly from WD and Future
 *  Domain) that all but the WD7000-EX have been out of production for
 *  two years now.  FD has production rights to the 7000-EX, and are
 *  producing it under a new name, and with a new BIOS.  If anyone has
 *  one of the FD boards, it would be nice to come up with a signature
 *  for it.
 *                                                           J.B. Jan 1994.
 *
 *
 *  Revisions by Miroslav Zagorac <zaga@fly.cc.fer.hr>
 *
 *  08/24/1996.
 *
 *  Enhancement for wd7000_detect function has been made, so you don't have
 *  to enter BIOS ROM address in initialisation data (see struct Config).
 *  We cannot detect IRQ, DMA and I/O base address for now, so we have to
 *  enter them as arguments while wd_7000 is detected. If someone has IRQ,
 *  DMA or I/O base address set to some other value, he can enter them in
 *  configuration without any problem. Also I wrote a function wd7000_setup,
 *  so now you can enter WD-7000 definition as kernel arguments,
 *  as in lilo.conf:
 *
 *     append="wd7000=IRQ,DMA,IO"
 *
 *  PS: If card BIOS ROM is disabled, function wd7000_detect now will recognize
 *      adapter, unlike the old one. Anyway, BIOS ROM from WD7000 adapter is
 *      useless for Linux. B^)
 *
 *
 *  09/06/1996.
 *
 *  Autodetecting of I/O base address from wd7000_detect function is removed,
 *  some little bugs removed, etc...
 *
 *  Thanks to Roger Scott for driver debugging.
 *
 *  06/07/1997
 *
 *  Added support for /proc file system (/proc/scsi/wd7000/[0...] files).
 *  Now, driver can handle hard disks with capacity >1GB.
 *
 *  01/15/1998
 *
 *  Added support for BUS_ON and BUS_OFF parameters in config line.
 *  Miscellaneous cleanup.
 *
 *  03/01/1998
 *
 *  WD7000 driver now work on kernels >= 2.1.x
