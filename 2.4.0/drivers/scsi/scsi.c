 * Function:    scsi_initialize_queue()

 * Arguments:   SDpnt   - device for which we need a handler function.
 *
 * Returns:     Nothing
 *
 * Lock status: No locking assumed or required.
 *
 * Notes:       Most devices will end up using scsi_request_fn for the
 *              handler function (at least as things are done now).
 *              The "block" feature basically ensures that only one of
 *              the blocked hosts is active at one time, mainly to work around
 *              buggy DMA chipsets where the memory gets starved.
 *              For this case, we have a special handler function, which
 *              does some checks and ultimately calls scsi_request_fn.
 *
 *              The single_lun feature is a similar special case.
 *
 *              We handle these things by stacking the handlers.  The
 *              special case handlers simply check a few conditions,
 *              and return if they are not supposed to do anything.
 *              In the event that things are OK, then they call the next
 *              handler in the list - ultimately they call scsi_request_fn
 *              to do the dirty deed.
