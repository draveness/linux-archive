 *  generic mid-level SCSI queueing.
 *
 *  The point of this is that we need to track when hosts are unable to
 *  accept a command because they are busy.  In addition, we track devices
 *  that cannot accept a command because of a QUEUE_FULL condition.  In both
 *  of these cases, we enter the command in the queue.  At some later point,
 *  we attempt to remove commands from the queue and retry them.

 *      2) Protect against multiple insertions of list at the same time.

 *      1) Set state of scsi command to a new state value for ml queue.
 *      2) Insert into queue when host rejects command.
 *      3) Make sure status code is properly passed from low-level queue func
 *         so that internal_cmnd properly returns the right value.
 *      4) Insert into queue when QUEUE_FULL.
 *      5) Cull queue in bottom half handler.
 *      6) Check usage count prior to queue insertion.  Requeue if usage
 *         count is 0.
 *      7) Don't send down any more commands if the host/device is busy.

 * Function:    scsi_mlqueue_insert()
 *
 * Purpose:     Insert a command in the midlevel queue.
 *
 * Arguments:   cmd    - command that we are adding to queue.
 *              reason - why we are inserting command to queue.
 *
 * Lock status: Assumed that lock is not held upon entry.
 *
 * Returns:     Nothing.
 *
 * Notes:       We do this for one of two cases.  Either the host is busy
 *              and it cannot accept any more commands for the time being,
 *              or the device returned QUEUE_FULL and can accept no more
 *              commands.
 * Notes:       This could be called either from an interrupt context or a
 *              normal process context.
